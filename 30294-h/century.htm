<h2><a name="preface" id="preface"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<div class="intro">
<p>This handbook treats essential matters of grammar, diction, spelling,
mechanics; and develops with thoroughness the principles of sentence
structure. Larger units of composition it leaves to the texts in formal
rhetoric.</p>

<p>The book is built on a decimal plan, the material being simplified and
reduced to one hundred articles. Headings of these articles are
summarized on two opposite pages by a <a href="chart.html">chart</a>. Here the student can see at
a glance the resources of the volume, and the instructor can find
immediately the number he wishes to write in the margin of a theme. The
chart and the decimal scheme together make the rules accessible for
instant reference.</p>

<p>By a device equally efficient, the book throws upon the student the
responsibility of teaching himself. Each article begins with a concise
rule, which is illustrated by examples; then follows a short "parallel
exercise" which the instructor may assign by adding an <i>x</i> to the number
he writes in the margin of a theme. While correcting this exercise, the
student will give attention to the rule, and will acquire theory and
practice at the same time. Moreover, every group of ten articles is
followed by mixed exercises; these may be used for review, or imposed in
the margin of a theme as a penalty for flagrant or repeated error. Thus
friendly counsel is backed by discipline, and the instructor has the
means of compelling the student to make rapid progress toward good
English.</p>

<p>Although a handbook of this nature is in some ways arbitrary, the
arbitrariness is always in the interest of simplicity. The book does
have simplicity, permits instant reference, and provides an adequate
drill which may be assigned at the stroke of a pen.</p>

<h2>TO THE STUDENT</h2>

<div class="intro">
<p>When a number is written in the margin of your theme, you are to turn to
the article which corresponds to the number. Read the rule (printed in
bold-face type), and study the examples. When an <i>r</i> follows the number
on your theme, you are, in addition, to copy the rule. When an <i>x</i>
follows the number, you are, besides acquainting yourself with the rule,
to write the exercise of five sentences, to correct your own faulty
sentence, and to hand in the six on theme paper. If the number ends in 9
(<a href="#article_9">9</a>, <a href="#article_19">19</a>, <a href="#article_29">29</a>, <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>), you will find, not a rule, but a long exercise which
you are to write and hand in on theme paper. In the absence of special
instructions from your teacher, you are invariably to proceed as this
paragraph requires.</p>

<p>Try to grasp the principle which underlies the rule. In many places in
this book the reason for the existence of the rule is clearly stated.
Thus under 20, the reason for the rule on parallel structure is
explained in a prologue. In other instances, as in the rule on divided
reference (<a href="#article_20">20</a>), the reason becomes clear the moment you read the
examples. In certain other instances the rule may appear arbitrary and
without a basis in reason. But there is a basis in reason, as you will
observe in the following illustration.</p>

<p>Suppose you write, "He is twenty one years old." The instructor asks you
to put a hyphen in <i>twenty-one</i>, and refers you to <a href="#article_78">78</a>. You cannot see
why a hyphen is necessary, since the meaning is clear without it. But
tomorrow you may write. "I will send you twenty five dollar bills." The
reader cannot tell whether you mean twenty five-dollar bills or
twenty-five dollar bills. In the first sentence the use of the hyphen in
<i>twenty-one</i> did not make much difference. In the second sentence the
hyphen makes seventy-five dollars' worth of difference. Thus the
instructor, in asking you to write, "He is twenty-one years old," is
helping you to form a habit that will save you from serious error in
other sentences. Whenever you cannot understand the reason for a rule,
ask yourself whether the usage of many clear-thinking men for long years
past may not be protecting you from difficulties which you do not
foresee. Instructors and writers of text books (impressive as is the
evidence to the contrary) are human, and do not invent rules to puzzle
you. They do not, in fact, invent rules at all, but only make convenient
applications of principles which generations of writers have found to be
wisest and best.</p>
</div>


<hr />
<h2><a name="sentence_structure" id="sentence_structure">SENTENCE STRUCTURE</a></h2>

<h3><a name="completeness_of_thought" id="completeness_of_thought"></a>COMPLETENESS OF THOUGHT</h3>

<div class="intro">
<p>The first thing to make certain is that the thought of a sentence is
complete. A fragment which has no meaning when read alone, or a sentence
from which is omitted a necessary word, phrase, or idea, violates an
elementary principle of writing.</p>
</div>

<h5><a name="article_1" id="article_1">Fragments Wrongly Used as Sentences</a></h5>

<p><b>1. Do not write a subordinate part of a sentence as if it were a
complete sentence.</b></p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Wrong: He stopped short. Hearing some one approach.</li>

<li>Right: He stopped short, hearing some one approach. [Or] Hearing some
one approach, he stopped short.</li>

<li>Wrong: The winters are cold. Although the summers are pleasant.</li>

<li>Right: Although the summers are pleasant, the winters are cold.</li>

<li>Wrong: The hunter tried to move the stone. Which he found very heavy.</li>

<li>Right: The hunter tried to move the stone, which he found very heavy.
[Or] The hunter tried to move the stone. He found it very heavy. </li>
</ul>

<p><a name="article_1_Note" id="article_1_Note">Note.</a>&mdash;A sentence must in itself express a complete thought. Phrases or
subordinate clauses, if used alone, carry only an incomplete meaning.
They must therefore be attached to a sentence, or restated in
independent form. Elliptical expressions used in conversation may be
regarded as exceptions: Where? At what time? Ten o'clock. By no means.
Certainly. Go.</p>

<p>Exercise:</p>

<ol class="exercise"><li>My next experience was in a grain elevator. Where I worked
for two summers.</li>

<li>The parts of a fountain pen are: first, the point. This is
gold. Second, the body.</li>

<li>The form is set rigidly. So that it will not be displaced
when the concrete is thrown in.</li>

<li>There are several reasons to account for the swarming of
bees. One of these having already been mentioned.</li>

<li>Since June the company has increased its trade three per
cent. Since August, five per cent.</li></ol>


<h5><a name="article_2" id="article_2">Incomplete Constructions</a></h5>

<p><b>2. Do not leave uncompleted a construction which you have begun.</b></p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Wrong: You remember that in his speech in which he said he
would oppose the bill.</li>

<li>Right: You remember that in his speech he said he would oppose
the bill. [Or] You remember the speech in which he said he
would oppose the bill.</li>

<li>Wrong: He was a young man who, coming from the country, with
ignorance of city ways, but with plenty of determination to
succeed.</li>

<li>Right: He was a young man who, coming from the country, was
ignorant of city ways, but had plenty of determination to
succeed.</li>

<li>Wrong: From the window of the train I perceived one of those
unsightly structures.</li>

<li>Right: From the window of the train I perceived one of those
unsightly structures which are always to be seen near a
station.</li></ul>


<p>Exercise:</p>

<ol class="exercise"><li>As far as his having been deceived, there is a difference of
opinion on that matter.</li>

<li>The fact that he was always in trouble, his parents wondered
whether he should remain in school or not.</li>

<li>People who go back to the scenes of their childhood
everything looks strangely small.</li>

<li>It was the custom that whenever a political party came into
office, for the incoming men to discharge all employees of the
opposite party.</li>

<li>Although the average man, if asked whether he could shoot a
rabbit, would answer in the affirmative, even though he had
never hunted rabbits, would find himself badly mistaken.</li></ol>


<h5><a name="article_3" id="article_3">Necessary Words Omitted</a></h5>

<p><b>3. Do not omit a word or a phrase which is necessary to an immediate
understanding of a sentence.</b></p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Ambiguous: I consulted the secretary and president. [Did the
speaker consult one man or two?]</li>

<li>Right: I consulted the secretary and the president. [Or] I
consulted the man who was president and secretary.</li>

<li>Ambiguous: Water passes through the cement as well as the
bricks.</li>

<li>Right: Water passes through the cement as well as through the
bricks.</li>

<li>Wrong: I have had experience in every phase of the automobile.</li>

<li>Right: I have had experience in every phase of automobile
driving and repairing.</li>

<li>Wrong: About him were men whom he could not tell whether they
were friends or foes.</li>

<li>Right: About him were men regarding whom he could not tell
whether they were friends or foes. [Or, better] About him were
men who might have been either friends or foes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Exercise:</p>

<ol class="exercise">
<li>When still a small boy, my family moved to Centerville.</li>

<li>Constantly in conversation with some one broadens our ideas
and our vocabulary.</li>

<li>It was a trick which opposing teams were sure to be
baffled.</li>

<li>They departed for the battle front with the knowledge they
might never return.</li>

<li>At the banquet were all classes of people; I met a banker
and plumber.</li></ol>


<h5><a name="article_4" id="article_4">Comparisons</a></h5>

<p><b>4. Comparisons must be completed logically.</b></p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Wrong: His speed was equal to a racehorse.</li>

<li>Wrong: Of course my opinion is worth less than a lawyer.</li>

<li>Wrong: The shells which are used in quail hunting are different
than in rabbit hunting.</li>
</ul>

<p>Compare a thing with another thing, an abstraction with another
abstraction. Do not carelessly compare a thing with a part or quality of
another thing. Always ask yourself: What is compared with what?</p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Right: His speed was equal to that of a racehorse.</li>

<li>Right: Of course my opinion is worth less than a lawyer's.</li>

<li>Right: The shells used in quail hunting are different from
those used in rabbit hunting.</li>

<li>Self-contradictory: Chicago is larger than any city in
Illinois.</li>

<li>Right: Chicago is larger than any other city in Illinois.</li>

<li>Impossible: Chicago is the largest of any other city in
Illinois.</li>

<li>Right: Chicago is the largest of all the cities in Illinois.
[Or] Chicago is the largest city in Illinois.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="article_3_Note" id="article_3_Note">Note.</a>&mdash;After a comparative, the subject of the comparison should be
excluded from the class with which it is compared; after a superlative,
the subject of the comparison should be included within the class.</p>

<ul class="examples">
<li>Wrong:
 <ul>
  <li>taller of all the girls.</li>
  <li>tallest of any girl.</li>
 </ul>
</li>

<li>Right:
 <ul>
  <li>taller than any other girl [comparative].</li>
  <li>tallest of all the girls [superlative].</li>
 </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Exercise:</p>

<ol class="exercise"><li>The climate of America helps her athletes to become superior
to other countries.</li>

<li>This tobacco is the best of any other on the market.</li>

<li>You men are paid three dollars more than any other factory
in the city.</li>

<li>I thought I was best fitted for an engineering course than
any other.</li>

<li>Care should be taken not to turn in more cattle than the
grass in the pasture.</li></ol>


<h5><a name="article_5" id="article_5">Cause and Reason</a></h5>

<p><b>5. A simple statement of fact may be completed by a <i>because</i> clause.</b></p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Right: I am late because I was sick.</li></ul>

<p><b>But a statement containing <i>the reason is</i> must be completed by a <i>that</i>
clause.</b></p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Wrong: The reason I am late is because I was sick. [The
"reason" is not a "because"; the "reason" is the fact of
sickness.]</li>

<li>Right: The reason I am late is that I was sick.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>Because</i>, the conjunction, may introduce an adverbial clause only.</b></p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Wrong: Because a man wears old clothes is no proof that he is
poor. [A <i>because</i> clause cannot be the subject of <i>is</i>.]</li>

<li>Right: The fact that a man wears old clothes is no proof that
he is poor. [Or] The wearing of old clothes is not proof that a
man is poor.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="article_5_Note" id="article_5_Note">Note.</a>&mdash;<i>Because of</i>, <i>owing to</i>, <i>on account of</i>, introduce adverbial
phrases only. <i>Due to</i> and <i>caused by</i> introduce adjectival phrases
only.</p>

<ul class="examples">
<li>Wrong: He failed, due to weak eyes. [Due is an adjective;
it cannot modify a verb.]</li>

<li>Right: His failure was

 <ul>
  <li>owing to</li>
  <li>on account of</li>
 </ul>
</div>

weak eyes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Exercise:</p>

<ol class="exercise">
<li>The reason why I would not buy a Ford car is because it is
too light.</li>

<li>My second reason for coming here is because of social
advantages.</li>

<li>Because John is rich does not make him happier than I.</li>

<li>Because I like farming is the reason I chose it.</li>

<li>The only reason why vegetation does not grow here is because
of the lack of water.</li>
</ol>


<h5><a name="article_6" id="article_6"><i>is when</i> or <i>is where</i> Clauses</a></h5>

<p><b>6. Do not use a <i>when</i> or <i>where</i> clause as a predicate noun. Do not
define a word by saying it is a "when" or a "where". Define a noun by
another noun, a verb by another verb, <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr></b></p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Wrong: The great event is when the train arrives.</li>

<li>Right: The great event is the arrival of the train.</li>

<li>Wrong: Immigration is where foreigners come into a country.</li>

<li>Right: Immigration is the entering of foreigners into a
country.</li>

<li>Wrong: A simile is when one object is compared with another.</li>

<li>Right: A simile is a figure of speech in which one object is
compared with another.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="article_6_Note" id="article_6_Note">Note.</a>&mdash;A definition of a term is a statement which (1) names the class
to which the term belongs, and (2) distinguishes it from other members
of the class. Example. A quadrilateral is a plane figure having four
sides and four angles. To test a definition ask whether it separates the
term defined from all other things. If the definition does not do this,
it is incomplete. Define <i>California</i> (so as to exclude other states),
<i>window</i> (so as to exclude <i>door</i>), <i>star</i> (exclude <i>moon</i>), <i>night</i>,
<i>rain</i>, <i>circle</i>, <i>Bible</i>, <i>metal</i>, <i>mile</i>, <i>rectangle</i>.</p>

<h5><a name="article_8" id="article_8">Transitions</a></h5>

<p>The state of mind of a writer is not the state of mind of his reader.
The writer knows his ideas, and has spent much time with them. The
reader meets these ideas for the first time, and must gather them in at
a glance. The relation between two ideas may be clear to the writer, and
not at all clear to the reader. Therefore,</p>

<p><b>8. In passing from one thought to another, make the connection clear. If
necessary, insert a word, a phrase, or even a sentence, to carry the
reader safely across.</b></p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Space transition needed: We were surprised to see a house in
the distance, but we went to the door and knocked. [This
sentence does not give a reader the effect of distance.]</li>

<li>Better: We were surprised to see a house in the distance. <i>But
we hastened toward it with thoughts of a warm meal and a good
lodging. We entered the yard</i>, and went up to the door, and
knocked.</li>

<li>Exterior-interior transition needed: We noticed that the house
was built of cobblestones. There was a broad window from which
we could look out upon the small stream that dashed down the
rocky hillside.</li>

<li>Better: We noticed that the house was built of cobblestones.
<i>We went inside, and found that the living room was large and
airy.</i> There was a broad window from which we could look out
upon the small stream that dashed down the rocky hillside.</li>

<li>Cause transition lacking: The Romans were great road-builders.
They wished to maintain their empire.</li>

<li>Better: The Romans were great road-builders, <i>because means of
moving troops quickly were necessary</i> to the maintenance of
their empire.</li>

<li>General-to-particular transition needed: Modern machinery often
makes men its slaves. Last summer I worked for the Chandler
Company. [This gap in thought occurs oftenest between the first
two sentences of a paragraph or theme.]</li>

<li>Better: Modern machinery often makes men its slaves. <i>This
truth is well illustrated by my own experience.</i> Last summer I
worked for the Chandler Company.</li>

<li>Transition to be improved by changing order: A careless trainer
may spoil a good colt. A good horse can never be made of a
vicious colt. [Here the order of ideas is: "Trainer ... colt.
Horse ... colt." Turn the last sentence end for end.]</li>

<li>Better: A careless trainer may spoil a good colt. And a vicious
colt can never be made a good horse. [Now the order of ideas is
"Trainer ... colt. Colt ... horse."]</li>

<li>Transition to be improved by removal of a disturbing element:
Our class in physics last week visited a pumping station in
which the Corliss type of steam engine is used. <i>The engines
are manufactured by the Allis-Chalmers Company of Milwaukee,
Wisconsin.</i> This type of engine is used because it has several
advantages. [The italicized sentence should be omitted here,
and used later in the theme.]</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="article_8_Note" id="article_8_Note">Note.</a>&mdash;The divisions of thought within a paragraph may likewise be
indicated by connectives: <i>however</i>, <i>on the other hand</i>, <i>equally
important</i>, <i>another interesting problem is</i>, <i>for this reason</i>, <i>the
remedy for this</i>, <i>so much for</i>, <i>it remains to mention</i>, <i>of course I
admit</i>, <i>finally</i>. (For a longer list see <a href="#article_36">36</a>.) Such phrases are also
useful in linking one paragraph to another.</p>

<p>When a student first learns the art, he is likely to use transition
phrases in excess, and produce something like the following: "When I
have to write a theme, I first think of my subject. As soon as I have my
subject, I take out my paper. On the paper I then make a rough outline."
This abuse of transition causes an overlapping of thought, like shingles
laid three inches to the weather. An abrupt transition is better than
wordiness.</p>

<h3><a name="unity_of_thought" id="unity_of_thought">UNITY OF THOUGHT</a></h3>

<div class="intro">
<p>Unity means oneness. A sentence should contain one thought. It may
contain two or more statements only when these are closely related parts
of a larger thought or impression. A writer should make certain, first,
that his thought has unity; and second, that this unity will be obvious
to the reader.</p>

<h5><a name="article_10" id="article_10">Unrelated Ideas in One Sentence</a></h5>

<p><b>10. Do not combine ideas which have no obvious relation to each other.
Place the ideas in separate sentences. Or, write the ideas as one
sentence, making their relation obvious.</b></p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Wrong: The Spartans did not care for literature, and lived in
the southern part of Greece.</li>

<li>Wrong: The coffee business is not difficult to learn, and the
most important work in preparing coffee for the market is the
roasting of the green berries.</li>
</ul>

<p>The simplest method of correction is to divide the sentence.</p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Right: The Spartans lived in the southern part of Greece. They
did not care for literature.</li>

<li>Right: The coffee business is not difficult to learn. The most
important work in preparing the coffee for the market is the
roasting of the green berries.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another method of correction is to subordinate one idea to the other, or
to change the wording until the relation between the ideas is obvious.</p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Right: The Spartans, who lived in the southern part of Greece,
did not care for literature.</li>

<li>Right: The coffee business is not difficult to learn, since the

<h5><a name="article_12" id="article_12">Stringy Sentences to be Broken up</a></h5>

<p><b>12. Avoid stringy compound sentences. The crude, rambling style which
results from their use may be corrected by separating the material into
shorter sentences, or by subordinating lesser ideas to the main thought.</b></p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Faulty: The second speaker had sat quietly waiting, and he was
a man of a different type, and he began calmly, yet from the
very first words he showed great earnestness.</li>

<li>Right: The second speaker, who had sat quietly waiting, was a

<li>Better: He published prose fiction, which was then the accepted
literary form, the drama being neglected. [This sentence makes
three statements in a diminishing series. The important idea is
expressed in a main clause; a less important explanation is
fitted into a relative clause; and a still less important
comment takes a parenthetical phrase at the end.]</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="article_12_Note" id="article_12_Note">Note.</a>&mdash;One of the crying faults of the immature writer is that by
excessive co&ouml;rdination he obscures the fine shades of meaning. When two

<h5><a name="article_13" id="article_13">Choppy Sentences to be Combined</a></h5>

<p><b>13. Do not use two or three short sentences to express ideas which will
make a more unified impression in one sentence. Place subordinate ideas
in subordinate grammatical constructions.</b></p>

<p><b>14. Do not use co&ouml;rdination when subordination will secure a more clear
and emphatic unit of thought. Especially do not co&ouml;rdinate a main idea

street, and since I wanted to know what was the matter, I asked
a man. [Two clauses are subordinated by the use of <i>when</i> and

<h4><a name="reference" id="reference">REFERENCE</a></h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>By the use of pronouns, participles, and other dependent words, language
becomes flexible and free. But each dependent part must refer without
confusion to a word which is reasonably near, and properly expressed.
Ordinarily a reader expects a pronoun or a participle to refer to the
nearest noun (or pronoun) or to an emphatic noun.</p>
</div>


<h5><a name="article_20">Divided Reference</a></h5>

<p><b>20. A pronoun should be placed near the word to which it refers, and
separated from words to which it might falsely seem to refer. If this
method does not secure clearness, discard the pronoun and change the
sentence structure.</b></p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Uncertain reference of <i>which</i>: He dropped the bundle in the
mud which he was carrying to his mother. [The reader for a
moment refers the pronoun to the wrong noun. Bring <i>which</i>
nearer to its proper antecedent <i>bundle</i>.]</li>

<li>Right: He dropped in the mud the bundle which he was carrying
to his mother.</li>

<li>Vague reference of <i>this</i>: My failure in mathematics was
serious. My grades in English, history, and Latin were good
enough. But this brought down my average. [<i>This?</i> What <i>this</i>?
Five nouns intrude between the pronoun <i>this</i> and its proper
antecedent <i>failure</i>.]</li>

<li>Right: In English, history, and Latin I received fairly good
grades. But in mathematics I received a failure. This brought
down my average.</li>

<li>Remote reference of <i>it</i>: If you want to make a good speech,
take your hands out of your pockets, open your mouth wide, and
throw yourself into it.</li>

<li>Right: If you want to make a good speech, take your hands out
of your pockets, open your mouth wide, and throw yourself into
what you are saying. [Or, better] Take your hands out of your
pockets, open your mouth wide, and throw yourself into the
speech.</li>

<li>Ambiguous reference of <i>he</i>: John spoke to the stranger, and he
was very surly.</li>

<li>Right: John spoke to the stranger, who was very surly. [Or]
John spoke in a surly manner to the stranger.</li></ul>

<p><a name="article_20_Note" id="article_20_Note">Note.</a>&mdash;The reference of relative and demonstrative pronouns is largely
dependent upon their position. The reference of a personal pronoun
(<i>he</i>, <i>she</i>, <i>they</i>, <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>) is not so much dependent upon its position,
the main consideration being that the antecedent shall be emphatic (See
<a href="#article_21">the next article</a>.)</p>

<h5><a name="article_21" id="article_21">Weak Reference</a></h5>

<p><b>21. Do not allow a pronoun to refer to a word not likely to be central
in the reader's thought; a word, for example, in the possessive case, or
in a parenthetical expression, or in a compound, or not expressed at
all. Make the pronoun refer to an emphatic word.</b></p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Wrong: When a poor woman came to Jane Addams' famous Hull
House, she always gave help. [<i>Poor woman</i> and <i>Hull House</i> are
the emphatic words, to which any pronoun used later is
instinctively referred by the reader.]</li>

<li>Right: When a poor woman came to Jane Addams' famous Hull
House, she always received help. [Or] When a poor woman came to
Hull House, Jane Addams always gave help.</li>

<li>Wrong: In biology, which is the study of plants and animals we
find that they are made up of unitary structures called cells.
[Since the words <i>plants and animals</i> occur only in a
parenthetical clause, the reader is surprised to find them used
as an antecedent.]</li>

<li>Right: I always liked engineering, and I have chosen it as my
profession.</li>

<li>Absurd: When the baby is through drinking milk, it should be
disconnected and put in boiling water. [The central idea in the
reader's mind is <i>baby</i>, not <i>milk-bottle</i>. The writer may have
been thinking about the <i>bottle</i>, but he did not make the word
emphatic; in fact, he did not express it at all.]</li>

<li>Right: When the baby is through drinking milk, the bottle
should be taken apart and put in boiling water.</li></ul>

<p><a name="article_21_Note" id="article_21_Note">Note.</a>&mdash;Ordinarily, do not refer to the title in the first line of a

<h5><a name="article_22" id="article_22">Broad Reference</a></h5>

<p><b>22. Do not use a pronoun to refer broadly to a general idea. Supply a
definite antecedent or abandon the pronoun.</b></p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Wrong: The tapper strikes the gong, which continues as long as
the push button is pressed. [The writer intends that <i>which</i>
shall refer to the entire preceding clause, but the reference
is intercepted by the word <i>gong</i>.]</li>

<li>Right [supplying a definite antecedent]: The tapper strikes the

<li>Right: The managers told him they would increase his salary if
he would represent them in South America. He refused the offer.</li></ul>

<p>Exception.&mdash;It cannot be maintained that a pronoun must <i>always</i> have
one definite word for its antecedent. Many of the best English authors
occasionally use a pronoun to refer to a clause. But the reference must
always be clear.</p>

<p><a name="article_22_Note" id="article_22_Note">Note.</a>&mdash;Impersonal constructions must be used with caution. "It is
raining" is correct, although <i>it</i> has no antecedent. We desire that the
antecedent shall be vague, impersonal. But unnecessary use of the
indefinite <i>it</i>, <i>you</i>, or <i>they</i> should be avoided.</p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Faulty: It says in our history that Columbus was an Italian.</li>

<h5><a name="article_23" id="article_23">Dangling Participle or Gerund</a></h5>

<p><b>23. A participle, being dependent, must refer to a noun or pronoun. The
noun or pronoun should be within the sentence which contains the
participle, and should be so conspicuous that the participle will be
associated with it instantly and without confusion.</b></p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Wrong: Coming in on the train, the high school building is
seen. [Is the building coming in? If not, who is?]</li>

<li>Right: Coming in on the train, one sees the high school
building.</li></ul>

<p>A sentence containing a dangling participle may be corrected (1) by
giving the word to which the participle refers a conspicuous position in
the sentence, or (2) by replacing the participial phrase by some other
construction.</p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Wrong: Having taken our seats, the umpire announced the
batteries.</li>

<li>Right: Having taken our seats, we heard the umpire announce
the batteries. [Or] When we had taken our seats, the umpire
announced the batteries.</li>

<li>Wrong: She was for a long time sick, caused by overwork. [The

<h4><a name="use_of_connectives" id="use_of_connectives">USE OF CONNECTIVES</a></h4>

<h5><a name="article_36" id="article_36">The Exact Connective</a></h5>

<p><b>36. Use a connective which expresses the exact relation between two
clauses. Distinguish between time and cause, concession and condition,
<abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr> Do not overwork <i>and</i>, <i>so</i>, or <i>while</i>.</b></p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Misleading: <i>While</i> he is sick, he is able to walk. [Use
<i>though</i>.]</li>

<li>Misleading: Miss Brown sang, <i>while</i> her sister spoke a piece.
[Use <i>but</i>.]</li>

<li>Faulty. Work hard <i>when</i> you want to succeed. [Use <i>if</i>.]</li>

<li>Faulty: They will be sorry <i>without</i> they do this. [Use
<i>unless</i>.]</li>

<li>Faulty: Little poetry is read, <i>only</i> at times when it is
compulsory. [Use <i>except</i>.]</li>

<li>Faulty. The early morning and evening are the best times to
find ducks, <i>and</i> we did not see many flying. [Use <i>and for
that reason</i>.]</li>

<li>Faulty: Corbin says: "In America sportsmanship is almost a
passion," <i>and</i> in England "the player very seldom forgets that
he is a man first and an athlete afterward." [Use <i>whereas</i>.]</li></ul>

<p><a name="article_36_Note" id="article_36_Note">Note.</a>&mdash;<i>So</i> is an elastic word that covers a multitude of vague
meanings. Language has need of such a word, and in many instances
(especially when the relation between clauses is obvious and does not
need to be pointed out) <i>so</i> serves well enough. Use it, but not as a
substitute for more exact connectives. Beware of falling into the
"<i>so</i>-habit."</p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Abuse of <i>so</i> as a vague co&ouml;rdinating connective: So I went to
call on Mrs. Woods, and so she told me about Mrs. White's new
gown; so then I missed the car, and so of course our supper is
late. [Strike out every <i>so</i>.]</li>

<li>Abuse of <i>so</i> as a subordinating connective: You may go, <i>so</i>
you keep still. [Use <i>provided</i>.] <i>So</i> you do only that, I
shall be satisfied. [Use <i>though</i>.]</li>

<li>Permissible: I was excited, so I missed the target.</li></ul>

<p><i>So</i> may sometimes be used to express result. But when a clause of
result is important and needs emphasis, it is perhaps better to strike
out <i>so</i> and subordinate the preceding clause.</p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Right: In my excitement I missed the target.</li>

<li>Right: Because I was excited, I missed the target.</li>

<h5><a name="article_40" id="article_40">Emphasis by Position</a></h5>

<p><b>40. Reserve the emphatic positions in a sentence for important words or
ideas. (The emphatic positions are the beginning and the end&mdash;especially
the end.)</b></p>

<h5><a name="article_43" id="article_43">The Periodic Sentence</a></h5>

<div class="intro">
<p>A sentence is periodic when the completion of the main thought is
delayed until the end. This delay creates a feeling of suspense. A
periodic sentence is doubly emphatic: it has emphasis by position
because the important idea comes at the end; it has emphasis by
subordination because all ideas except the last one are grammatically
dependent.</p>
</div>

<p><b>43. To give emphasis to a loosely constructed sentence, turn it into
periodic form.</b></p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Loose: I saw two men fight a duel, many years ago, on a moonlit
summer night, in a little village in northern France. [What is
most important, the time? the place? or the actual duel? Place
the important idea last.]</li>

<li>Periodic: Many years ago, on a moonlit summer night, in a
little village in northern France, I saw two men fight a duel.</li>

<li>Loose: We left Yellowstone Gateway for the ride of our lives in
a six-horse tally-ho. [Place the important idea last, <i>and make
all other ideas grammatically subordinate</i>.]</li>

<li>Periodic: Leaving Yellowstone Gateway in a six-horse tally-ho,
we had the ride of our lives.</li>

<li>Loose: The river was swollen with incessant rain, and it swept
away the dam. [Which is the important idea? Why not make it
appear more important by subordinating everything to it?]</li>

<li>Periodic: The river, swollen with incessant rain, swept away
the dam.</li>

<li>Loose: War means to have our pursuit of knowledge and happiness
rudely broken off, to feel the sting of death and bereavement,
to saddle future generations with a burden of debt and national
hatred.</li>

<li>Periodic: To have our pursuit of knowledge and happiness rudely

<h5><a name="article_45" id="article_45">The Balanced Sentence</a></h5>

<p><b>45. Two ideas similar or opposite in thought gain in emphasis when set
off, one against the other, in similar constructions.</b></p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Weak and straggling: This paper, like many others, has many bad
features, but in some ways it is very good. The news articles
are far better than the editorials, which are feeble.</li>

<li>Balanced structure: This paper is in some respects good; in
other respects very poor. The news articles are impressive, the
editorials are feeble.</li>

<li>Weak and complicated: From the East a man who lives in the West
can learn a great deal, and an Easterner ought to be able to
understand the West.</li>

<li>Balanced: A Westerner can learn much from the East, and an
Easterner needs to understand the West.</li>

<li>Weak: Both Mill and Macaulay influenced the younger writers.
Mill taught some of them to reason, but many more of them
learned from Macaulay only a superficial eloquence.</li>

<li>Balanced: Both Mill and Macaulay influenced the younger
writers. If Mill taught some of them to reason, Macaulay
tempted many more of them to declaim.</li></ul>

<p><a name="article_45_Note" id="article_45_Note">Note.</a>&mdash;Although excessive use of balance is artificial, occasional use
of it is powerful. It can give to writing either dignity (as in an
oration) or point (as in an epigram). Observe how many proverbs are in
balanced structure. "Seeing is believing.&mdash;Nothing venture, nothing
have.&mdash;For every grain of wit there is a grain of folly.&mdash;You cannot do
wrong without suffering wrong.&mdash;An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."
Note the effective use of balance in Emerson's <i>Essays</i>, particularly in
<i>Compensation</i>; and in the Old Testament, particularly in <i>Psalms</i> and
<i>Proverbs</i>.</p>

<p>Exercise:</p>

<ol class="exercise"><li>Machinery is of course labor-saving, but countless men are

<li>I attend concerts for the pleasure of it, and to get an
understanding of music.</li>

<li>The stag in the fable admired his horns and blamed his feet;
but when the hunter came, his feet saved him, and afterward,
caught in the thicket, he was destroyed by his horns.</li>

<li>We do not see the stars at evening, sometimes because there
are clouds intervening, but oftener because there are
glimmerings of light; thus many truths escape us from the
obscurity we stand in, and many more from the state of mind
which induces us to sit down satisfied with our imaginations
and of our knowledge unsuspicious. [This sentence is correctly
balanced, except at the end.]</li></ol>


<h5><a name="article_46" id="article_46">The Weak Effect of the Passive Voice</a></h5>

<p><b>46. Use the active voice unless there is a reason for doing otherwise.
The passive voice is, as the name implies, not emphatic.</b></p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Weak: Your gift is appreciated by me.</li>

<li>Better: I appreciate your gift.</li>

<li>Weak and vague: His step on the porch was heard.</li>

<li>Better: His step sounded on the porch. [Or] I heard his step on
the porch.</li></ul>

<p>The passive voice is especially objectionable when by failing to
indicate the agent of the verb it unnecessarily mystifies the reader.</p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Vague: The train was seen speeding toward us.</li>

<li>Better: We saw the train speeding toward us.</li></ul>

<p>Exercise:</p>

<h5><a name="article_47" id="article_47">Effective Repetition</a></h5>

<p><b><a name="article_47a">47a.</a> The simplest and most natural way to emphasize a word or an idea is
to repeat it.</b> The Bible is the best standard of simplicity and dignity
in our language, and the Bible uses repetition constantly. A word or
idea that is repeated must, of course, be important enough to deserve
emphasis.</p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Fairly emphatic: He works and toils and labors, but he seems
never to get anywhere.</li>

<li>Very emphatic: Work, work, work, all he does is work, and still
he seems never to get anywhere.</li>

<li>Fairly emphatic: How did the general meet this new menace? He
withdrew before it!</li>

<li>Very emphatic: How did the general meet this new menace? He
withdrew! He retreated! He ran away!</li>

<li>Homely but emphatic: "I went under," said the old salt; "bows,
gunnels, and starn&mdash;all under."</li>

<li>Deliberately too emphatic: Everywhere we hear of
efficiency&mdash;efficiency experts, efficiency bureaus, efficiency
methods, in the office, in the school, in the home&mdash;until one
longs to fly to some savage island beyond the reach of inhuman
modern science.</li></ul>

<p><b><a name="article_47b">b.</a> Not only words, but an entire grammatical structure may be repeated

[This sentence is flimsy and spineless because the writer had a
timid reluctance to repeat.]</li>

<li>Strong: We hope that this shipment will reach you in good

<i>We believe</i>, <i>We assure</i>.]</li>

<li>Emphatic: Through the patience, the courage, the high character
of Alfred the country was saved&mdash;saved from the rapacities of

the sluggish despair of the people of England themselves.</li>

<li>Emphatic and natural: This corner of the garden was my first
playground. Here I made my first toddling effort to walk. Here
on the soft grass I learned the delight of out-of-doors. Here I
became acquainted with the bull-frog, and the bumble-bee, and
the neighbor's dog.</li>

<li>Emphatic and delightful: He maketh me to lie down in green

<h5><a name="article_48" id="article_48">Offensive Repetition</a></h5>

<div class="intro">
<p>Careless repetition attracts attention to words that do not need
emphasis. It is extremely annoying to the reader.</p>
</div>

<p><b><a name="article_48a" id="article_48a">48a.</a> Unless a word or phrase is repeated deliberately to gain force or
clearness, its repetition is a blunder. Get rid of recurring expressions
in one of three ways: (1) by substituting equivalent expressions, (2) by
using pronouns more liberally, (3) by rearranging the sentence so as to
say once what has awkwardly been said twice.</b> Each of these schemes is
illustrated below.</p>

<p><b>1.</b> Repetition cured by the use of equivalent expressions (synonyms).</p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Bad: <i>Just</i> as we were half way down the lake, <i>just</i> off
Milwaukee, we <i>began</i> to feel a slight motion of the ship and
the <i>wind began</i> to freshen. The <i>wind began</i> to blow more
fiercely from the south and the waves <i>began</i> to leap high. The
boat <i>began</i> to pitch and roll.</li>

<li>Right: <i>Just</i> as we were half way down the lake, <i>opposite</i>
Milwaukee, we began to feel a slight motion of the ship, for
the wind <i>had</i> freshened. Before long <i>a gale</i>, <i>blowing</i> from
the south, <i>kicked up a heavy sea and caused</i> the boat to pitch
and roll. [Notice how combining the last two sentences helps to
solve the problem of the last <i>began</i>, besides giving firmer
texture to the construction.]</li></ul>

<p><b>2.</b> Repetition cured by the use of pronouns. (In using this method, one
should take care that the reference of the pronouns is clear.)</p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Bad: The <i>Law Building</i>, the <i>Commerce Building</i>, and the
<i>Science Building</i> are close together. The <i>Commerce Building</i>
is south of the <i>Law Building</i>, and the <i>Science Building</i> is
south of the <i>Commerce Building</i>. The <i>Law Building</i> is old and
dilapidated. The <i>Commerce Building</i> is a red brick <i>building</i>,
trimmed in terra-cotta. The <i>Science Building</i> resembles the
<i>Commerce Building</i>.</li>

<li>Right: The Law, Commerce, and Science Buildings are close
together in a row. <i>The first of these</i> is old and dilapidated.
South of it stands the Commerce Building, <i>which</i>, because of
<i>its</i> red brick and terra-cotta trimmings, somewhat resembles
the Science Building.</li></ul>

<p><b>3.</b> Repetition cured by rearranging and condensing.</p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Bad: The <i>autumn</i> is my favorite of all the <i>seasons</i>. While
<i>autumn</i> in the <i>city</i> is not such a pleasant <i>season</i> as
<i>autumn</i> in the country, yet even in the <i>city</i> my preference
will always be for the <i>autumn</i>.</li>

<li>Right: My favorite season is autumn. I like it best in the
country, but even in the city it is the best time of the year.</li></ul>

<p><b><a name="article_48b" id="article_48b">b.</a> Avoid a monotonous repetition of sentence structure. To give variety
to successive sentences: (1) vary the length, (2) vary the beginnings,
(3) avoid a series of similar compound sentences, (4) interchange loose
with periodic structure, (5) use rhetorical question, exclamation,
direct discourse, (6) avoid an excessive use of participles or
adjectives.</b></p>

<p><b>1.</b> Vary the length of sentences.</p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Bad: Walter came up the path carrying Betty in his arms. She
was wet from head to toe. Damp curls clung to her pale face.
Water dripped from her clothes. One hand hung loosely over
Walter's arm. The other held a live duckling. She had saved
the little duck from drowning. This was Betty's first day in
the country.</li>

<li>Right: Walter came up the path carrying Betty in his
arms&mdash;little Betty who was spending her first day in the
country. She was wet from head to toe; damp curls clung to her
pale face, and water dripped from her clothes. In one hand she
held a live duckling. Her face lighted with courage as she told
how she jumped into the pond and saved the little duck from
drowning.</li></ul>

<p><b>2.</b> Vary the beginnings of sentences. Do not allow too many sentences to
begin with the subject, or with a time clause, or with a participle, or
with <i>so</i>. When you have finished a composition, rapidly read over the
opening words of each sentence, to see if there is sufficient variety.</p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Bad [too many sentences begin directly with the subject]: Our
way is circuitous. A sharp turn brings us round a rocky point.
The road drops suddenly into a little valley. The roof of a
house appears in a grove of trees below. A cottage is there and
a flower garden. An old-fashioned well is near the door.</li>

<li>Right: Presently, on our circuitous way, we make a sharp turn
round a rocky point. Before us the road drops suddenly into a
little valley. In a grove of trees below appears the roof of a
house, and as we draw nearer we see a cottage surrounded by
flowers. Nothing could be more attractive to a weary traveler
than the old-fashioned well near the door.</li></ul>

<p><b>3.</b> Avoid a series of similar compound sentences, especially those of two
parts of equal length, joined by <i>and</i> or <i>but</i>.</p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Bad: Ring was a sheep dog, and tended the flock with his
master. One day there came a deep snow, and the flock did not
return. They found the herder frozen stiff, and the dog

<li>Right: Ring was a sheep dog, and tended the flock with his
master. One day there came a deep snow. When the flock failed

<p><b>4.</b> Change occasionally from loose to periodic or balanced structure (See
<a href="#article_43">43</a> and <a href="#article_45">45</a>).</p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Monotonous: I stood at the foot of Tunbridge hill. I saw on the
horizon a dense wood, which, in the evening sunlight, was
veiled in purple haze [Loose]. On the left was the village, the
houses appearing like specks in the distance [Loose]. Nearer on
the right was the creek, winding through the willows [Loose].
The creek approached nearer until it reached the dam, over
which it rushed tumultuously [Loose]. Near by was a thicket of
tall trees, through which I could see the white tents of my
fellow campers, and their glowing camp fires [Loose].</li>

<li>Right: Far south from Tunbridge hill, on the dim horizon, I
saw, veiled in the evening haze, a dense wood [Periodic, long,
conveying the idea of distance better than a loose sentence].
On my left stood the village, the houses like specks; on my
right wound the creek, nearer and nearer through the willows
[Balanced]. The creek advanced by slow sinuous turns, until,
reaching the dam, it plunged over tumultuously [Loose]. Through
a thicket of tall trees, near at hand, I could see the white
tents of my fellow campers, and their glowing camp fires
[Periodic through the middle of the sentence; then loose].</li></ul>

<p><b>5.</b> Use question, exclamation, direct quotation.</p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Somewhat flat: He asked me the road to Camden. I did not know.
I told him to ask Thurber, who knew the country well.</li>

<li>Better: He asked me the road to Camden. The road to Camden? How
should I know? "Ask Thurber," I said impatiently; "he knows
this country. I'm a stranger."</li></ul>

<p><b>6.</b> Avoid an excessive use of participles. Do not pile adjectives around
every noun. Above all, do not form a habit of using adjectives in pairs
or triplets.</p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Bad: Sitting by the window, I saw a sharp, dazzling flash of
lightning, and heard a loud rumbling crash of heavy thunder,
warning me of the coming of the storm. Darting across the gray,
leaden sky, the quick, jagged lightning flashed incessantly.
The tall stately poplar trees thrashed around in the boisterous
wind. Then across the window, like a great white curtain, swept
the streaming, blinding rain.</li>

<li>Right: I sat by the window. Suddenly a sharp flash of lightning

<h5><a name="article_58" id="article_58">Parts of Speech, Other Grammatical Terms, Conjugation</a></h5>

<h6>The Parts of Speech and Their Uses</h6>

<dl class="regular"><dt>Noun.</dt><dd>A noun is a name. It may be <b>proper</b> (<i>Philip Watkins</i>), or
<b>common</b>. Common nouns may be <b>concrete</b> (<i>man</i>, <i>windmill</i>), or
<b>abstract</b> (<i>gratitude</i>, <i>nearness</i>). <b>A</b> noun applied to a group
is said to be <b>collective</b> (<i>family</i>, <i>race</i>). The uses of a
noun <b>are</b>: to serve as the subject of a verb, to serve as the
object of a verb or a preposition, to be in apposition with
another noun (Jenkins, our <i>coach</i>), to indicate possession
(<i>Joseph's</i> coat of many colors); and less frequently, to serve
as an adjective (the <i>brick</i> sidewalk) or adverb (John went
<i>home</i>), and to indicate direct address (<i>Jehovah</i>, help us!).</dd>

<dt>Pronoun.</dt><dd>A pronoun is a word which takes the place of a noun.
It may be <b>personal</b> (<i>I</i>, <i>thou</i>, <i>you</i>, <i>he</i>, <i>she</i>, <i>it</i>,
<i>we</i>, <i>they</i>), <b>relative</b> (<i>who</i>, <i>which</i>, <i>what</i>, <i>that</i>, <i>as</i>,
and compounds <i>whoever</i>, <i>whichsoever</i>, <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>), <b>interrogative</b>
(<i>who</i>, <i>which</i>, <i>what</i>), <b>demonstrative</b> (<i>this</i>, <i>that</i>,
<i>these</i>, <i>those</i>), or <b>indefinite</b> (<i>some</i>, <i>any</i>, <i>one</i>, <i>each</i>,
<i>either</i>, <i>neither</i>, <i>none</i>, <i>few</i>, <i>all</i>, <i>both</i>, <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>).
Strictly speaking, the last two groups, demonstratives and
indefinites, are adjectives used as pronouns. Certain pronouns
are also used as adjectives, notably the <b>possessives</b> (<i>my</i>,
<i>his</i>, <i>their</i>, <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>) and the relative or interrogative <i>which</i>
and <i>what</i>. The addition of <i>-self</i> to a personal pronoun forms
a <b>reflexive pronoun</b> or <b>intensive</b> (I blamed <i>myself</i>. You
<i>yourself</i> are at fault). A noun for which the pronoun stands
is called the <b>antecedent</b>. The uses of pronouns are in general
the same as those of nouns. In addition, relatives serve as
connectives (the man <i>who</i> spoke), interrogatives ask questions
(<i>what</i> man?), and demonstratives point out (<i>that</i> man).</dd>

<dt>Verb.</dt><dd>A verb is a word or word-group which makes an assertion
about the subject. It may express either action or mere
existence. It may be <b>transitive</b> (<i>trans</i> meaning "across";
hence action carried across, requiring a receiver of the act;
Brutus <i>stabbed</i> C&aelig;sar; C&aelig;sar is <i>stabbed</i>) or <b>intransitive</b>
(not requiring a receiver of the act: Montgomery <i>fell</i>). Its
meaning is dependent upon its voice, mode, and tense. Voice
shows the relationship between the subject and the assertion
made by the verb. The <b>active voice</b> shows the subject as actor
(They <i>elected</i> Washington); the <b>passive voice</b>, as acted upon
(Washington <i>was elected</i>). (A transitive verb may be active or
passive, but an intransitive verb has no voice.) Mode indicates
the manner of predicating an action, whether as assertion,
condition, command, <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr> There are three modes in English. The
<b>indicative mode</b> affirms or denies (He <i>went</i>. She <i>did not
dance</i>.) The <b>subjunctive</b> expresses condition or wish (If he
<i>were</i> older, he would be wiser. Would that I <i>were</i> there!).
The <b>imperative</b> expresses command or exhortation (<i>Remain</i>
there. <i>Go!</i> <i>Let</i> us pray). <b>Modal auxiliaries</b> with these three
modes form <b>modal aspects</b> of the verb. There are as many
different aspects as there are auxiliaries. Aspects are
sometimes spoken of as separate modes or called collectively
the "potential mode." Tense expresses the time of the action or
existence. The tenses are the <b>present</b>, the <b>past</b>, the <b>future</b>
(employing the auxiliaries <i>shall</i> and <i>will</i>), the <b>perfect</b>
(employing <i>have</i>), the <b>past perfect</b> (employing <i>had</i>), and the
<b>future perfect</b> (employing <i>shall have</i> and <i>will have</i>).
<b>Verbals</b> are certain forms of the verb used as other parts of
speech (noun, adjective, adverb). For the verbal forms,
infinitive, gerund, and participle, see the separate headings.</dd>

<dt>Adjective.</dt><dd>An adjective is a word used to modify a noun or
pronoun. An adjective may be <b>attributive</b> (<i>bright</i> sun,
<i>cool-headed</i> adventurers) or <b>predicate</b> (The field is <i>broad</i>.
The meat tastes <i>bad</i>. I want this <i>ready</i> by Christmas).
Adjectives assume three forms known as degrees of comparison.
The <b>positive degree</b> indicates the simple quality of the object
without reference to any other. The <b>comparative degree</b>
indicates that two objects are compared (Stanley is the <i>older</i>
brother). The <b>superlative degree</b> indicates that three or more
objects are compared (Stanley is the <i>oldest</i> child in the
family) or that the speaker feels great interest or emotion (A
<i>most excellent</i> record). Ordinarily <i>er</i> or <i>r</i> is added to
the positive to form the comparative, and <i>est</i> or <i>st</i> to the
positive to form the superlative (brave, braver, bravest). But
some adjectives (sometimes those of two, and always those of
more than two, syllables) prefix <i>more</i> (or <i>less</i>) to the
positive to form the comparative, and <i>most</i> (or <i>least</i>) to
the positive to form the superlative (beautiful, more
beautiful, most beautiful). Some adjectives express qualities
that do not permit comparison (<i>dead</i>, <i>four-sided</i>,
<i>unique</i>).</dd>

<dt>Adverb.</dt><dd>An adverb is a word used to modify a verb, an
adjective, another adverb (She played <i>well</i>; <i>unusually</i>
handsome; <i>very</i> sternly); or, more rarely, a verbal noun
(Walking <i>fast</i> is good for the health), a preposition (The
ship drifted <i>almost</i> upon the breakers), or a conjunction (It
came <i>just</i> when we wished). Certain adverbs (<i>fatally</i>,
<i>entirely</i>) do not logically admit of comparison. Those that do
are compared like adjectives of more than two syllables
(<i>slowly</i>, <i>more</i> or <i>less slowly</i>, <i>most</i> or <i>least slowly</i>).</dd>

<dt>Preposition.</dt><dd>A preposition is a connective <i>placed before</i> a
substantive (called its object) in order to subordinate the
substantive to some other word in a sentence (The boast <i>of</i>
heraldry, the pomp <i>of</i> power. He ran <i>toward</i> the enemy
<i>without</i> fear).</dd>

<dt>Conjunction.</dt><dd>A conjunction is a word used to <i>join together</i>
words, phrases, clauses, or sentences. A <b>co&ouml;rdinate conjunction</b>
connects elements of equal rank (See <a href="#article_36">36</a>).
<b>Correlative conjunctions</b> are conjunctions used in pairs (See
<a href="#article_31">31</a>). A <b>subordinate conjunction</b> is one that
connects elements unequal in rank (See <a href="#article_36">36</a>). When a
conjunction, in addition to its function as a connective,
indicates a relation of time, place, or cause, it is often
called a <b>conjunctive adverb</b> or <b>relative adverb</b>.</dd>

<dt>Interjection.</dt><dd>An interjection is a word <i>thrown into</i> speech to
express emotion. It has no grammatical connection with other
words. (<i>Oh</i>, is that it? <i>Well</i>, I'll do it. <i>Hark!</i>)</dd></dl>

<h6>Other Grammatical Terms</h6>

<dl class="regular"><dt>Absolute expression.</dt><dd>An expression (usually composed of a
substantive and a participle, perhaps with modifiers) which,
though not formally and grammatically joined, is in thought
related to the remainder of the sentence. (<i>The relief party
having arrived</i>, we went home. <i>This disposed of</i>, the council
proceeded to other matters. <i>Defeated</i>, he was not dismayed.)</dd>

<dt>Antecedent.</dt><dd>A substantive to which a pronoun or participle
refers. Literally, <i>antecedent</i> means <i>that which goes
before</i>; but sometimes the antecedent follows the dependent
word. (The <i>man</i> who hesitates is lost. Entering the store,
<i>we</i> saw a barrel of apples.) <i>Man</i> is the antecedent of the
pronoun <i>who</i>, and <i>we</i> is the antecedent of the participle
<i>entering</i>.</dd>

<dt>Auxiliary.</dt><dd><i>Be</i>, <i>have</i>, <i>do</i>, <i>shall</i>, <i>will</i>, <i>ought</i>, <i>may</i>,
<i>can</i>, <i>must</i>, <i>might</i>, <i>could</i>, <i>would</i>, <i>should</i>, <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>, when
used with participles and infinitives of other verbs, are
called auxiliary verbs.</dd>

<dt>Case.</dt><dd>The relation of a substantive to other words in the
sentence as shown by inflectional form or position. The subject
of a verb, or the predicate of the verb <i>to be</i>, is in the
nominative case. The object of a verb or preposition, or the
"assumed subject" of an infinitive, is in the objective case. A
noun or pronoun which denotes possession is in the possessive
case.</dd>

<dt>Clause.</dt><dd>A portion of a sentence which contains a subject and a
verb, perhaps with modifiers. The following sentence contains
one dependent (subordinate) and one independent (principal)
clause: <i>When the storm ceased, the grove was a ruin</i>.</dd>

<dt>Conjugation.</dt><dd>The inflectional changes in the verb to indicate
person, number, tense, voice, mode, and modal aspect.</dd>

<dt>Declension.</dt><dd>The changes in a noun, pronoun, or adjective to
indicate person, number, or case.</dd>

<dt>Ellipsis, elliptical expression.</dt><dd>An expression partially
incomplete, so that words have to be understood to complete the
meaning. An idea or relation corresponding to the omitted words
is present, at least vaguely, in the mind of the speaker.
Elliptical sentences are usually justifiable except when the
reader cannot instantly supply the understood words. Examples
of proper ellipses: You are as tall as I [am tall]. Is your
sister coming? I think [my sister is] not [coming]. I will go
if you will [go]. [I give you] Thanks for your advice.</dd>

<dt>Gerund.</dt><dd>A verbal in <i>-ing</i> used as a noun. (I do not object to
your <i>telling</i>. His <i>having deserted</i> us makes little
difference.) The gerund may be regarded as a special form of
the infinitive.</dd>

<dt>Infinitive.</dt><dd>A verbal ordinarily introduced by <i>to</i> and used as
a noun (<i>To err</i> is human). In such sentences as "The road to
follow is the river road," <i>follow</i> may be regarded as the noun
of a phrase (compare <i>the road to Mandalay</i>), or the entire
phrase may be regarded as an adjective. Similarly, in "He
hastened to comply," <i>comply</i> may be regarded as a noun or <i>to
comply</i> as an adverb. After certain verbs (<i>bid</i>, <i>dare</i>,
<i>help</i>, <i>make</i>, <i>need</i>, <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>) the <i>to</i> is omitted from the
infinitive group. (He bids me <i>go</i>. I need not <i>hesitate</i>.)</dd>

<dt>Inflection.</dt><dd>Change in the form of a word to show a modification
or shade of meaning. At a very early period in our language
there was a separate form for practically every modification.
Although separate forms are now less numerous, <i>inflection</i> is
still a convenient term in grammar. Its scope is general: it
includes the declension of nouns, the comparison of adjectives
and adverbs, and the conjugation of verbs.</dd>

<dt>Modify.</dt><dd>To be grammatically dependent upon and to limit or
alter the quality of. In the expression "The very old man,"
<i>the</i> and <i>old</i> modify <i>man</i>, and <i>very</i> modifies <i>old</i>.</dd>

<dt>Participle.</dt><dd>A verbal used as an adjective, or as an adjective
with adverbial qualities. In the sentence "Mary, being oldest,
is also the best liked," <i>being oldest</i> refers exclusively, or
almost exclusively, to the subject and is therefore adjectival.
In such sentences as "He fell back, exhausted" and "Running
down the street, I collided with a baby carriage," the
participle refers in part to the verb and is therefore
adverbial as well as adjectival.</dd>

<dt>Phrase.</dt><dd>A group of words forming a subordinate part of a
sentence and not containing a subject and its verb. Examples:
<i>With a whistle and a roar</i> the train arrived [prepositional
phrase]. <i>Bowing his head</i>, the prisoner listened to the
verdict of the jury [participial phrase]. In a loose,
untechnical sense <i>phrase</i> may refer to any short group of
words, even if the group includes a subject and its verb.</dd>

<dt>Predicate.</dt><dd>The word or word-group in a sentence which makes an
assertion about the subject. It consists of a finite verb with
or without objects or modifiers.</dd>

<dt>Predicate adjective.</dt><dd>An adjective in the predicate, usually
linked with the subject by some form of the verb <i>to be</i> (<i>is</i>,
<i>was</i>, <i>were</i>, <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>). (John is <i>lazy</i>. The soldiers were very
<i>eager</i>.)</dd>

<dt>Predicate noun.</dt><dd>A noun linked with the subject by some form of
the verb <i>to be</i>. (John is <i>halfback.</i> They were our
<i>neighbors.</i>)</dd>

<dt>Sentence.</dt><dd>A sentence is a group of words containing (1) a
subject (with or without modifiers) and a predicate (with or
without modifiers) and not grammatically dependent on any words
outside of itself; or (2) two or more such expressions related
in thought. Sentences of type 1 are simple or complex;
sentences of type 2 are compound. A <b>simple sentence</b> contains
one independent clause (The dog barks angrily). A <b>complex
sentence</b> contains one independent clause and one or more
subordinate clauses (The dog barks when the thief appears). A
<b>compound sentence</b> contains two or more independent clauses (The
dog barks, and the thief runs).</dd>

<dt>Substantive.</dt><dd>A noun or a word standing in place of a noun. (The
<i>king</i> summoned <i>parliament</i>. The <i>bravest</i> are the
<i>tenderest</i>. <i>She</i> was inconsolable.) A <b>substantive phrase</b> is a
phrase used as a noun. (<i>From Dan to Beersheba</i> is a term for
the whole of Israel.) A <b>substantive clause</b> is a clause used as
a noun. (<i>That he owed the money</i> is certain.)</dd>

<dt>Syntax.</dt><dd>Construction; the grammatical relation between the
words, phrases, and clauses in a sentence.</dd>

<dt>Verbal.</dt><dd>Any form of the verb used as another part of speech.
Infinitives, gerunds, and participles are verbals. They are
used to express action without asserting it, and cannot,
therefore, have subjects or be used as predicate verbs.</dd></dl>

activities, unnecessary friction, since it lowers the amount of
nervous energy, is going to lower the per cent of efficiency.
While we may never reach an astonishing degree of efficiency by
economizing nervous energy, nevertheless, if we consistently
and perseveringly try to spare ourselves all unnecessary labor
and exertion, we shall have an abundant supply of energy to
direct into channels of usefulness. [100 words.]</li>

expression which, though correct in grammar and general meaning,
combines words in a manner contrary to usage. Idioms are established by
custom, and cannot be explained by logical rules. "I enjoy to read" is
wrong, not because the words offend logic or grammar, but merely because
people do not instinctively make that combination of words. "I like to
read" and "I enjoy reading" are good idioms.</p>

<p><b><a name="article_65b" id="article_65b">b.</a> Do not carry the standards of conversation into formal writing.</b>
Colloquial usage is more free than literary usage. The colloquial
sentence <i>That's the man I talked with</i> becomes in writing <i>That is the
man with whom I talked.</i> The colloquial sentence <i>It was a cold day but
there wasn't any wind blowing</i> is a loose string of words. Written
discourse requires greater tension and more care in subordinating minor
ideas: <i>The day, though cold, was still.</i> Contractions are proper in
conversation, and in personal or informal writing. In formal writing
they are not appropriate. And do not let such expressions as <i>He
doesn't</i>, <i>We aren't</i>, <i>It's proved</i>, used in talk by careful speakers,
mislead you into expressions like <i>He don't</i>, <i>We ain't</i>, <i>It's proven</i>,
which violate even colloquial good use.</p>

<h5><a name="article_66" id="article_66">Gross Violations of Good Use: Barbarisms, Improprieties, Slang</a></h5>

<p><b>66. Avoid gross violations of good use, particularly (a) barbarisms, (b)
improprieties, and (c) slang.</b></p>

<p><b><a name="article_66a" id="article_66a">a.</a> Barbarisms are distortions of words in good use, or coinages for
which there is no need.</b> Examples: <i>to concertize</i>, <i>to burgle</i> or
<i>burglarize</i>, <i>to jell</i>, <i>alright</i>, <i>a-plenty</i>, <i>most</i> (for <i>almost</i>),
<i>performess</i>, <i>fake</i>, <i>pep</i>, <i>tasty</i>, <i>illy</i>, <i>complected</i>,
<i>undoubtably</i>, <i>nowheres</i>, <i>soph</i>, <i>lab</i>, <i>gents</i>.</p>

<p><b><a name="article_66b" id="article_66b">b.</a> Improprieties are words wrenched from one part of speech to another,
or made to perform an unnatural service.</b> Examples: <i>to suspicion</i>, <i>to
gesture</i>, <i>to suicide</i>, <i>a steal</i>, <i>a try</i>, <i>a go</i>, <i>an invite</i>, <i>the
eats</i>, <i>humans</i>, <i>some</i> or <i>real</i> or <i>swell</i> (as adverbs), <i>like</i> (as a
conjunction).</p>

<p><b><a name="article_66c" id="article_66c">c.</a> Slang is speech consisting either of uncouth expressions of
illiterate origin, or of legitimate expressions used in grotesque or
irregular senses.</b> Though sometimes (witness eighteenth century <i>mob</i>,
and nineteenth century <i>buncombe</i>) it satisfies a real need and becomes
established in the language, in most instances it is short-lived
(witness the thieves' talk in <i>Oliver Twist</i>, or passages from any comic
opera song popular five years ago). Vicious types of slang are:</p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Expressions of vulgar origin (from criminal classes, the prize
ring, the vaudeville circuit, <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>): <i>get pinched</i>, <i>down and
out</i>, <i>took the count</i>, <i>bum hunch</i>, <i>nix on the comedy
stuff</i>, <i>get across</i>.</li>

<li>Language strained or distorted for novel effect: <i>performed the
feed act at a bang-up gastronomic emporium</i>, <i>bingled a tall
drive that made the horsehide ramble out into center garden</i>.</li>

<li>Blanket expressions used as substitutes for thinking:
<i>corking</i>, <i>stunning</i>, <i>ain't it fierce?</i><ins title="Transcriber's Note: The original was missing comma">,</ins> <i>can you beat it?</i><ins title="Transcriber's Note: The original was missing comma">,</ins>
<i>going some</i>, <i>just so I get by with it</i>.</li></ul>

<p>The use of the last-named type is most to be regretted. It leads to a
mental habit of phonographic repetition, with no resort to independent
thinking. If a man really desires to use slang, let him invent new
expressions every day, and make them fit the specific occasion.</p>

<p><b>68. Avoid faulty diction.</b></p>


<dl class="regular"><dt><i>Ad</i></dt><dd>(for <i>advertisement</i>). Avoid in formal writing and
speaking.</dd>

<dt><i>Ain't</i>.</dt><dd>Never correct. Say <i>I'm not</i>, <i>you</i> [<i>we</i>, <i>they</i>]
<i>aren't</i>, <i>he</i> [<i>she</i>, <i>it</i>] <i>isn't</i>.</dd>

<dt><i>All the farther</i>, <i>all the faster</i>.</dt><dd>Crude. Use <i>as far as</i>, <i>as
fast as</i>, in such sentences as "This is all the farther I can
go."</dd>

<dt><i>As</i>.</dt><dd>(a) Incorrect in the sense of <i>that</i> or <i>whether</i>. "I
don't know <i>whether</i> (not <i>as</i>) I can tell you." "Not <i>that</i>
(not <i>as</i>) I know." (b) <i>As ... as</i> are correlatives. <i>Than</i>
must not replace the second <i>as</i>. Right: "As good as or better
than his neighbors." "As good as his neighbors, or better [than
they]." See <a href="#article_57">57</a>.</dd>

<dt><i>Auto</i>.</dt><dd>An abbreviation not desirable in formal writing.</dd>

<dt><i>Awful</i>.</dt><dd>Means <i>filling with awe</i> or <i>filled with awe</i>. Do not
use in the sense of <i>uncivil</i>, <i>serious</i>, or <i>ludicrous</i>, or
(in the adverbial form) in the sense of <i>very</i>, <i>extremely</i>.</dd>

<dt><i>Balance</i>.</dt><dd>Incorrect when used in the sense of <i>remainder</i>.</dd>

<dt><i>Because</i>.</dt><dd>Not to be used for <i>the fact that</i>. "<i>The fact that</i>
(not <i>because</i>) he is absent is no reason why we should not
proceed." See <a href="#article_5">5</a>.</dd>

<dt><i>Between</i>.</dt><dd>Used of two persons or things. Not to be confused
with <i>among</i>, which is used of more than two.</dd>

<dt><i>Blame on</i>.</dt><dd>A crudity for <i>put the blame on</i> or <i>blame</i>.
Faulty: "Don't blame it on me." Better: "Don't blame me."</dd>

<dt><i>Borned</i>.</dt><dd>A monstrosity for <i>born</i>. "I was <i>born</i> (not
<i>borned</i>) in 1899."</dd>

<dt><i>Bursted</i>.</dt><dd>The past tense of <i>burst</i> is the same as the
present.</dd>

<dt><i>Bust</i> or <i>busted</i>.</dt><dd>Vulgar for <i>burst</i>. Right: "The balloon
burst." "The bank failed."</dd>

<dt><i>But what</i>.</dt><dd><i>That</i> is often preferable. "I do not doubt <i>that</i>
(not <i>but what</i>) he is honest."</dd>

<dt><i>Canine</i>.</dt><dd>An adjective. Not in good use as a noun.</dd>

<dt><i>Cannot help but</i>.</dt><dd>A confusion of <i>can but</i> and <i>cannot help</i>.
"I can but believe you"; or "I cannot help believing you"; not
"I cannot help but believe you." See <a href="#article_34">34</a>.</dd>

<dt><i>Caused by</i>.</dt><dd>To be used only when it refers definitely to a
noun. Wrong: "He was disappointed, caused by the lateness of
the train." The noun <i>disappointment</i> should be used instead of
the verb <i>disappointed</i>. Then caused will have a definite
reference. Right: "His disappointment was caused by the
lateness of the train." See <a href="#article_23">23</a>.</dd>

<dt><i>Claim</i>.</dt><dd>Means <i>to demand as a right</i>. Incorrect for <i>maintain</i>
or <i>assert</i>.</dd>

<dt><i>Considerable</i>.</dt><dd>An adjective, not an adverb. "He talked
<i>considerably</i> (not <i>considerable</i>) about it."</dd>

<dt><i>Could of</i>.</dt><dd>An illiterate form arising from slovenly
pronunciation. Use <i>could have</i>. Avoid also <i>may of</i>, <i>must
of</i>, <i>would of</i>, <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr></dd>

<dt><i>Data</i>.</dt><dd>Plural. The singular (seldom used) is <i>datum</i>. Compare
<i>stratum</i>, <i>strata</i>; <i>erratum</i>, <i>errata</i>.</dd>

<dt><i>Demean</i>.</dt><dd>Means <i>to conduct oneself</i>, not <i>to lower</i> or <i>to
degrade</i>.</dd>

<dt><i>Different than</i>.</dt><dd><i>Different from</i> is to be preferred. <i>Than</i>
is a conjunction. The idea of separation implied in <i>different</i>
calls for a preposition, rather than a word of comparison.</dd>

<dt><i>Disremember</i>.</dt><dd>Not in good use.</dd>

<dt><i>Done</i>.</dt><dd>A gross error when used as the past tense of <i>do</i>, or
as an adverb meaning <i>already</i>. "<i>I did it</i> (not <i>I done it</i>)."
"I've <i>already</i> (not <i>done</i>) got my lessons."</dd>

<dt><i>Don't</i>.</dt><dd>A contraction for <i>do not</i>; never to be used for <i>does
not</i>. The contraction of <i>does not</i> is <i>doesn't</i>. See
<a href="#article_51d">51d</a>.</dd>

<dt><i>Drownded</i>.</dt><dd>Vulgar for <i>drowned</i>.</dd>

<dt><i>Due to</i>.</dt><dd>To be used only when it refers definitely to a noun.
Faulty: "He refused the offer, due to his father's opposition."
Right: "His refusal of the offer was due to his father's
opposition." The noun <i>refusal</i> should be used instead of the
verb <i>refused</i>. Then <i>due</i> will have a definite reference. See
<a href="#article_5">5</a>.</dd>

<dt><i>Enthuse</i>.</dt><dd>Not in good use.</dd>

<dt><i><abbr title="Et cetera">Etc.</abbr></i></dt><dd>An abbreviation for the Latin <i>et cetera</i>, meaning <i>and
other</i> [things]. <i>Et</i> means <i>and</i>. <i>And <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr></i> is therefore
grossly incorrect. Do not write <i>ect.</i></dd>

<dt><i>Expect</i>.</dt><dd>Means <i>to look forward to</i>. Hardly correct in the
sense of <i>suppose</i>.</dd>

<dt><i>Fine</i>.</dt><dd>Use cautiously as an adjective, and not at all as an
adverb. Seek the exact word. See <a href="#article_62">62</a>.</dd>

<dt><i>Former</i>.</dt><dd>Means the first or first named of two. Not to be used
when more than two have been named. The corresponding word is
<i>latter</i>.</dd>

<dt><i>For to</i>.</dt><dd>Incorrect for <i>to</i>. "I want <i>you</i> (not <i>for you</i>) to
listen carefully." "He made up his mind <i>to</i> (not <i>for to</i>)
accept."</dd>

<dt><i>Gent</i>.</dt><dd>A vulgar abbreviation of <i>gentleman</i>.</dd>

<dt><i>Good</i>.</dt><dd>An adjective, not an adverb. Wrong: "He did good in
mathematics." Right: "He did well in mathematics." "He did good
work in mathematics."</dd>

<dt><i>Gotten</i>.</dt><dd>An old form now usually replaced by <i>got</i> except in
such expressions as <i>ill-gotten gains</i>.</dd>

<dt><i>Guess</i>.</dt><dd>Expresses conjecture. Not to be used in formal
composition for <i>think</i>, <i>suppose</i>, or <i>expect</i>.</dd>

<dt><i>Had of</i>.</dt><dd>Illiterate. "I wish I <i>had known</i> (not <i>had of
known</i>) about it."</dd>

<dt><i>Had ought</i>.</dt><dd>A vulgarism. "He <i>ought</i> (not <i>had ought</i>) to
have resigned." <ins title="Transcriber's Note: The original was missing a quotation mark">"</ins>We <i>oughtn't</i>
(not <i>hadn't ought</i>) to make this error."</dd>

<dt><i>Hardly</i>.</dt><dd>Not to be used with a negative. See <a href="#article_34">34</a>.</dd>

<dt><i>Home</i>.</dt><dd>Do not use when you mean simply <i>house</i>.</dd>

<dt><i>Human</i> or <i>humans</i>.</dt><dd>Not in good use as a noun. Say <i>human
being</i>. Right: "The house was not fit for <i>human beings</i> (not
<i>humans</i>) to live in."</dd>

<i>if</i>) the laundry will be finished today."</dd>

<dt><i>In</i>.</dt><dd>Often misused for <i>into</i>. "He jumped <i>into</i> (not <i>in</i>)
the pond."</dd>

<dt><i>It's</i>.</dt><dd>Means <i>it is</i>; not to be written for the possessive
<i>its</i>.</dd>

<dt><i>Kind of</i>.</dt><dd>(a) Should not modify adjectives or verbs. "He was
<i>somewhat</i> (not <i>kind of</i>) lean." "<i>She partly suspected</i> (not
<i>She kind of suspected</i>) what was going on." (b) When using
with a noun, do not follow by <i>a</i>. "That kind of man"; not
"That kind of a man."</dd>

<dt><i>Like</i>.</dt><dd>To be followed by a substantive; never by a substantive
and a verb. "He ran like a deer." "Do <i>as</i> (not <i>like</i>) I do."
"She felt <i>as if</i> (not <i>like</i>) she was going to faint." <i>Like</i>
is a preposition; <i>as</i> is a conjunction.</dd>

<dt><i>Literally</i>.</dt><dd>Do not use where you plainly do not mean it, as in
the sentence, "I was literally tickled to death."</dd>

<dt><i>Loan</i>.</dt><dd><i>Lend</i> is in better use as a verb.</dd>

<dt><i>Locate</i>.</dt><dd>Do not use for <i>settle</i> or <i>establish oneself</i>.</dd>

<dt><i>Lose out</i>.</dt><dd>Not used in formal writing. Say <i>lose</i>.</dd>

<dt><i>Might of</i>.</dt><dd>A vulgarism for <i>might have</i>.</dd>

<dt><i>Most</i>.</dt><dd>Do not use for <i>almost</i>. "<i>Almost</i> (not <i>most</i>) all."</dd>

<dt><i>Myself</i>.</dt><dd>Intensive or reflexive; do not use when the simple
personal pronoun would suffice. "I saw them myself." "Some
friends and <i>I</i> (not <i>myself</i>) went walking."</dd>

<dt><i>Neither</i>.</dt><dd>Used with <i>nor</i>, and not with <i>or</i>. "Neither the man
whom his associates had suspected <i>nor</i> (not <i>or</i>) the one whom
the police had arrested was the criminal." "She could neither
paint a good picture <i>nor</i> (not <i>or</i>) play the violin well."</dd>

<dt><i>Nice</i>.</dt><dd>Means <i>delicate</i> or <i>precise</i>. <i>Nice</i> is used in a
loose colloquial way to indicate general approval, but should
not be so used in formal writing. Right: "He displayed nice
judgment." "We had a <i>pleasant</i> (not <i>nice</i>) time." See
<a href="#article_62">62</a>.</dd>

<dt><i>Nowhere near</i>.</dt><dd>Vulgar for <i>not nearly</i>.</dd>

<dt><i>Nowheres</i>.</dt><dd>Vulgar.</dd>

<dt><i>O</i> and <i>Oh</i>.</dt><dd><i>O</i> is used with a noun in direct address; it is
not separated from the noun by any marks of punctuation. <i>Oh</i>
is used as an interjection; it is followed by a comma or an
exclamation point. "Hear, O king, what thy servants would say."
"Oh, dear!"</dd>

<dt><i>Of</i>.</dt><dd>Do not use for <i>have</i> in such combinations as <i>should
have</i>, <i>may have</i>, <i>ought to have</i>.</dd>

usually preferable.</dd>

<dt><i>Ought to of</i>.</dt><dd>A vulgarism for <i>ought to have</i>.</dd>

<dt><i>Over with</i>.</dt><dd>Crude for <i>over</i>.</dd>

<dt><i>Pants</i>.</dt><dd><i>Trousers</i> is the approved term in literary usage.
<i>Pants</i> (from <i>pantaloons</i>) has found some degree of colloquial
and commercial acceptance.</dd>

<dt><i>Party</i>.</dt><dd>Not to be used for <i>person</i>, except in legal phrases.</dd>

<dt><i>Phone</i>.</dt><dd>A contraction not employed in formal writing. Say
<i>telephone</i>.</dd>

<dt><i>Plenty</i>.</dt><dd>A noun; not in good use as an adjective or an adverb.
"He had <i>plenty of</i> (not <i>plenty</i>) resources." "He had
<i>resources in plenty</i> (not <i>resources plenty</i>)."</dd>

<dt><i>Proposition</i>.</dt><dd>Means a <i>thing proposed</i>. Do not use loosely, as
in the sentence: "A berth on a Pullman is a good proposition

<i>real</i>) intelligent." "He was <i>really</i> (not <i>real</i>) brave."</dd>

<dt><i>Remember of</i>.</dt><dd>Not to be used for <i>remember</i>.</dd>

<dt><i>Right smart</i> and <i>Right smart of</i>.</dt><dd>Extremely vulgar.</dd>

<i>much</i>, <i>a great deal of</i>. "<i>A great many</i> (not <i>a sight</i>) of
them."</dd>

<dt><i>So</i>.</dt><dd>Not incorrect, but loose, vague, and often unnecessary.
(a) As an intensive, the frequent use of <i>so</i> has been
christened "the feminine demonstrative." Hackneyed: "I was so
surprised." Better: "I was much surprised." Or, "I was
surprised." (b) As a connective, the frequent use of <i>so</i> is a
mark of amateurishness. See <a href="#article_36_Note">36 Note</a>.</dd>

<dt><i>Some</i>.</dt><dd>Not to be used as an adverb. "She was <i>somewhat</i> (not
<i>some</i>) better the next day." Wrong: "He studied some that

<dt><i>Somewheres</i>.</dt><dd>Very crude. Use <i>somewhere</i>.</dd>

<dt><i>Species</i>.</dt><dd>Has the same form in singular and plural. "He
discovered a new <i>species</i> (not <i>specie</i>) of sunflower."</dd>

<dt><i>Such</i>.</dt><dd>(a) To be completed by <i>that</i>, rather than by <i>so
that</i>, when a result clause follows. "There was such a crowd
<i>that</i> (not <i>so that</i>) he did not find his friends." (b) To be
completed by <i>as</i>, rather than by <i>that</i>, <i>who</i>, or <i>which</i>,
when a relative clause follows. "I will accept such
arrangements <i>as</i> (not <i>that</i>) may be made." "He called upon
such soldiers <i>as</i> (not <i>who</i>) would volunteer for this service
to step forward."</dd>

<dt><i>Superior than</i>.</dt><dd>Not in good use for <i>superior to</i>.</dd>

<dt><i>Sure</i>.</dt><dd>Avoid the crude adverbial use. "It <i>surely</i> (not
<i>sure</i>) was pleasant." In answer to the question, "Will you
go?" either <i>sure</i> or <i>surely</i> is correct, though <i>surely</i> is
preferred. "[To be] sure." "[You may be] sure." "[I will]
surely [go]."</dd>

<dt><i>Suspicion</i>.</dt><dd>A noun. Never to be used as a verb.</dd>

<dt><i>Take and</i>.</dt><dd>Often unnecessary, sometimes crude. Redundant: "He
took the ax and sharpened it." Better: "He sharpened the ax."
Crude: "He took and nailed up the box." Better: "He nailed up
the box."</dd>

<dt><i>Tend</i>.</dt><dd>In the sense <i>to look after</i>, takes a direct object
without an interposed <i>to</i>. <i>Attend</i>, however, is followed by
<i>to</i>. "The milliner's assistant <i>tends</i> (not <i>tends to</i>) the
shop." "I shall <i>attend to your wants in a moment</i>."</dd>

<dt><i>That there</i>.</dt><dd>Do not use for <i>that</i>. "I want <i>that</i> (not <i>that
there</i>) box of berries."</dd>

<dt><i>Them</i>.</dt><dd>Not to be used as an adjective. "<i>Those</i> (not <i>them</i>)
boys."</dd>

<dt><i>There were</i> or <i>There was</i>.</dt><dd>Avoid the unnecessary use. Crude:
"There were seventeen senators voted for the bill." Better:
"Seventeen senators voted for the bill."</dd>

<dt><i>These sort</i>, <i>These kind</i>.</dt><dd>Ungrammatical. See
<a href="#article_51b">51b</a>.</dd>

<dt><i>This here</i>.</dt><dd>Do not use for <i>this</i>.</dd>

<dt><i>Those</i>.</dt><dd>Do not carelessly omit a relative clause after
<i>those</i>. Faulty: "He is one of those talebearers." Better: "He
is a talebearer." [Or] "He is one of those talebearers whom
everybody dislikes."</dd>

<dt><i>Those kind</i>, <i>those sort</i>.</dt><dd>Ungrammatical. See <a href="#article_51b">51b</a>.</dd>

<dt><i>Till</i>.</dt><dd>Do not carelessly misuse for <i>when</i>: "I had scarcely
strapped on my skates <i>when</i> (not <i>till</i>) Henry fell through an
air hole."</dd>

<dt><i>Transpire</i>.</dt><dd>Means <i>to give forth</i> or <i>to become known</i>, not
<i>to occur</i>. "The secret <i>transpired</i>." "The sale of the
property <i>occurred</i> (not <i>transpired</i>) last Thursday."</dd>

<dt><i>Try</i>.</dt><dd>A verb, not a noun.</dd>

<dt><i>Unique</i>.</dt><dd>Means <i>alone of its kind</i>, not <i>odd</i> or <i>unusual</i>.</dd>

<dt><i>United States</i>.</dt><dd>Ordinarily preceded by <i>the</i>. "The United
States raised a large army." (Not "United States raised a large
army.")</dd>

<dt><i>Up</i>.</dt><dd>Do not needlessly insert after such verbs as <i>end</i>,
<i>rest</i>, <i>settle</i>.</dd>

<dt><i>Used to could</i>.</dt><dd>Very crude. Say <i>used to be able</i> or <i>once
could</i>.</dd>

<dt><i><ins title="Transcriber's Note: The original had 'Verb'">Very</ins></i>.</dt><dd>Accompanied by <i>much</i> when used with
the past participle. "He was <i>very much</i> (not <i>very</i>) pleased
with his reception."</dd>

<dt><i>Want to</i>.</dt><dd>Not to be used in the sense of <i>should</i>, <i>had
better</i>. "You <i>should</i> (not <i>You want to</i>) keep in good
physical condition."</dd>

persons. "The friends <i>who</i> (not <i>which</i>) had loved him in his
boyhood were still faithful to him."</dd>

referring to animals. Do not use the possessive form <i>whose</i>
for <i>of which</i> unless the sentence is so turned as practically
to require the substitution.</dd>

<dt><i>Will</i>.</dt><dd>Do not confuse with <i>shall</i>. See <a href="#article_53">53</a>.</dd>

<h2><a name="spelling" id="spelling">SPELLING</a></h2>

<div class="intro">
<p>No one is able to spell all unusual words on demand. But every one must
spell correctly even unusual words in formal writing. The writer has
time or must take time to consult a dictionary. The best dictionaries
are <i>Webster's New International Dictionary</i>, the <i>Standard Dictionary</i>
(less conservative than Webster's), the <i>Century Dictionary and
Cyclopedia</i> (Volume 2 of the <i>Century</i> is the best place to look for
proper names), and <i>Murray's New English Dictionary</i> (very thorough,
each word being illustrated with numerous quotations to show historical
development). An abridged edition of one of these (the price is one to
three dollars) should be accessible to each student who cannot buy the
larger volumes. The best are: <i>Webster's Secondary School Dictionary</i>,
<i>Funk and Wagnalls Desk Standard Dictionary</i>, the <i>Oxford Concise
Dictionary</i>, and <i>Webster's Collegiate Dictionary</i>.</p>

<p>But the student will be spared constant recourse to the dictionary, and
will save himself much time and many humiliations, if he will employ the
rules and principles which follow.</p>
</div>


<h5><a name="article_70" id="article_70">Recording Errors</a></h5>

<p><b>70. Keep a list of all the words you misspell, copying them several
times in correct form.</b> Concentrate your effort upon a few words at a
time&mdash;upon those words which you yourself actually misspell. The list
will be shorter than you think. It may comprise not more than twenty or
thirty words. Unless you are extraordinarily deficient, it will
certainly not comprise more than a hundred or a hundred and fifty. Find
where your weakness lies; then master it. You can accomplish the
difficult part of the task in a single afternoon. An occasional review,
and constant care when you write, will make your mastery permanent.</p>

<p>After this, and only after this, begin slowly to learn the spelling of
words which you do not yourself use often, but which are a desirable
equipment for all educated men. See the list under <a href="#article_79">79</a>.
<em>Concentrate your efforts upon a few words at a time.</em> It is better to
know a few exactly than a large number hazily. Form the mental habit of
being always right with a small group of words, and extend this group
gradually.</p>

<p>Exercise:</p>

<p class="exercise">Prepare for your instructor a corrected list of words which you
have misspelled in your papers to the present time.</p>


<h5><a name="article_71" id="article_71">Pronouncing Accurately</a></h5>

<p><b>71. Avoid slovenly pronunciation.</b> Careful articulation makes for
correctness in spelling.</p>

<p>Watch the vowels of unaccented syllables; give them distinct (not
exaggerated) utterance, at least until you are familiar with the
spelling. Examples: <i title="Transcriber's Note: The word 'separate' with the first letter 'a' emphasized">sep<b>a</b>rate</i>, <i title="Transcriber's Note: The word 'opportunity' with the second letter 'o' emphasized">opp<b>o</b>rtunity</i>, <i title="Transcriber's Note: The word 'everybody' with the first letter 'y' emphasized">ever<b>y</b>body</i>, <i title="Transcriber's Note: The word 'sophomore' with the second letter 'o' emphasized">soph<b>o</b>more</i>,
<i title="Transcriber's Note: The word 'divine' with the first letter 'i' emphasized">d<b>i</b>vine</i>.</p>

<p>Sound accurately all the consonants between syllables, and do not sound
a single consonant twice. Examples: <i title="Transcriber's Note: The word 'candidate' with the first letter 'd' emphasized">can<b>d</b>idate</i>, <i title="Transcriber's Note: The word 'government' with the first letter 'n' emphasized">gover<b>n</b>ment</i>,
<i title="Transcriber's Note: The word 'surprise' with the first letter 'r' emphasized">su<b>r</b>prise</i> (not <i title="Transcriber's Note: Intentionally misspelled word 'surprise' with the first letter 'r' replaced with letter 'p' and the second letter 'r' emphasized">supp<b>r</b>ise</i>), <i  title="Transcriber's Note: The word 'omission' with the letters 'm' and 'ss' emphasized">o<b>m</b>i<b>ss</b>ion</i> (<ins title="Transcriber's Note: The original had the word 'compare' italicized">compare</ins> <i title="Transcriber's Note: The word 'occasion' with letters 'cc' and 's' emphasized">o<b>cc</b>a<b>s</b>ion</i>), <i title="Transcriber's Note: The word 'defer' with the letter 'f' emphasized">de<b>f</b>er</i>
(compare <i title="Transcriber's Note: The word 'differ' with the letters 'ff' emphasized">di<b>ff</b>er</i>).</p>

<p>Sound the <i>g</i> in final <i>-ing</i>. Examples: <i>eating</i>, <i>running</i>.</p>

<p>Pronounce the <i>-al</i> of adverbs derived from adjectives in <i>-ic</i> or
<i>-al</i>. Examples: <i>tragically</i>, <i>occasionally</i>, <i>generally</i>,
<i>ungrammatically</i>.</p>

<p>Do not transpose letters; place each letter where it belongs. Examples:
<i title="Transcriber's Note: The word 'perspiration' with the letters 'er' emphasized">p<b>er</b>spiration</i> (not <i title="Transcriber's Note: The word 'perspiration' intentionally misspelled as 'prespiration' and letters 're' emphasized">p<b>re</b>spiration</i>), <i title="Transcriber's Note: The word 'tragedy' with the letter 'g' emphasized">tra<b>g</b>edy</i> (not <i title="Transcriber's Note: The word 'tragedy' intentionally misspelled as 'tradegy' with the letters 'd' and 'g' emphasized">tra<b>d</b>e<b>g</b>y</i>).</p>

<p><a name="article_71_Note" id="article_71_Note">Note.</a>&mdash;The principle of phonetic spelling as stated above applies to
many words, but by no means to all. The Simplified Spelling Board would
extend this principle by changing the spelling of words to correspond
with their actual sounds. It recommends such forms as <i>tho</i>, <i>thru</i>,
<i>enuf</i>, <i>quartet</i>, <i>catalog</i>, <i>program</i>. If the student employs these
forms, he must use them consistently. Many writers oppose simplified
spelling; many advocate it; many compromise. Others desire to supplant
our present alphabet with one more nearly phonetic, and prefer, until
this fundamental reform takes place, to preserve our present spelling as
it is.</p>

<p>Exercise:</p>

<p class="exercise">Copy the following words slowly, pronouncing the syllables as
you write: <i>accidentally</i>, <i>accommodate</i>, <i>accurately</i>,
<i>artistically</i>, <i>athletics</i> (not <i>atheletics</i>), <i>boundary</i>,
<i>candidate</i>, <i>cavalry</i>, <i>commission</i>, <i>curiosity</i>, <i>defer</i>,
<i>definite</i>, <i>description</i>, <i>despair</i>, <i>different</i>, <i>dining
room</i>, <i>dinned</i>, <i>disappoint</i>, <i>divide</i>, <i>divine</i>,
<i>emphatically</i>, <i>eighth</i>, <i>everybody</i>, <i>February</i>, <i>finally</i>,
<i>goddess</i>, <i>government</i>, <i>hundred</i>, <i>hurrying</i>, <i>instinct</i>,

<h5><a name="article_72" id="article_72">Logical Kinship in Words</a></h5>

<p><b>72. Get help in spelling a difficult word by thinking of related words.</b>
To think of <i>ridiculous</i> will prevent your writing <i>a</i> for the second
<i>i</i> of <i>ridicule</i>; to think of <i>ridicule</i> will prevent your writing
<i>rediculous</i>. To think of <i>prepare</i> will prevent your writing
<i>preperation</i>; to think of <i>preparation</i> will forestall <i>preparitory</i>.
To think of <i>busy</i> will save you from the monstrosity <i>buisness.</i> To
think of the prefixes <i>re-</i> (meaning <i>again</i>) and <i>dis-</i> (meaning
<i>not</i>), and the verbs <i>commend</i> and <i>appoint</i>, will prevent your writing
<i>recommend</i> or <i>disappoint</i> with a double <i>c</i> or <i>s</i>.</p>

<p><a name="article_72_Note" id="article_72_Note">Note.</a>&mdash;The relationship between words is not always a safe guide to
spelling. Observe <i>four</i>, <i>forty</i>; <i>nine</i>, <i>ninth</i>; <i>maintain</i>,
<i>maintenance</i>; <i>please</i>, <i>pleasant</i>; <i>speak</i>, <i>speech</i>; <i>prevail</i>,
<i>prevalent</i>. Do not confuse the following prefixes, which have no
logical connection:</p>

<h5><a name="article_75" id="article_75">Doubling a Final Consonant</a></h5>

<p><b>75. Monosyllables and words accented on the final syllable, if they end
in one consonant preceded by a single vowel, double the consonant before
a suffix beginning with a vowel.</b></p>

<p>Examples: (a) Words derived from monosyllables: <i>plan-ned</i>, <i>clan-nish</i>,
<i>get-ting</i>, <i>hot-test</i>, <i>bag-gage</i>, (b) Words derived from words
accented on the final syllable: <i>begin-ning</i>, <i>repel-lent</i>,
<i>unregret-ted</i>.</p>

<p><a name="article_75_Note1" id="article_75_Note1">Note 1.</a>&mdash;There are four distinct steps in the application of this rule.
(1) The primary word must be found. To decide whether <i>begging</i> contains
two <i>g's</i>, we must first think of <i>beg</i>. (2) The primary word must be a
monosyllable or a word accented on the final syllable. <i>Hit</i> and <i>allot</i>
meet this test; <i>open</i> does not. <i>Deferred</i> and <i>differed</i>, <i>preferred</i>
and <i>proffered</i>, <i>committed</i> (or <i>committee</i>) and <i>prohibited</i> double or
refrain from doubling the final consonant of the primary word according
to the position of the accent. The seeming discrepancy between
<i>preferred</i> and <i>preferable</i>, between <i>conferred</i> and <i>conference</i>, is
due to a shifting of the accent to the first syllable in the case of
<i>preferable</i> and <i>conference</i>. (3) The primary word must end in one
consonant. <i>Trace</i>, <i>oppose</i>, <i>interfere</i>, <i>help</i>, <i>reach</i>, and
<i>perform</i> fail to meet this test, and therefore in derivatives do not
double the last consonant. <i>Assurance</i> has one <i>r</i>, as it should have;
<i>occurrence</i> has two <i>r's</i>, as it should have. (4) The final consonant
of the primary word must be preceded by a single vowel. This principle
excludes the extra consonant from <i>needy</i>, <i>daubed</i>, and <i>proceeding</i>,
and gives it to <i>running</i>.</p>

<p><a name="article_75_Note2" id="article_75_Note2">Note 2.</a>&mdash;After <i>q</i>, <i>u</i> has the force of <i>w</i>. Hence <i>quitting</i>,
<i>quizzes</i>, <i>squatter</i>, <i>acquitted</i>, <i>equipped</i>, and similar words are
not really exceptions to the rule.</p>

<p>Exercise:</p>

<ol class="exercise"><li>Write the present participle (in <i>-ing</i>) of <i>din</i> (not
<i>dine</i>), <i>begin</i>, <i>sin</i> (compare <i>shine</i>), <i>stop</i>, <i>prefer</i>,

<h5><a name="article_76" id="article_76">Final <i>e</i> before a Suffix Beginning with a Vowel</a></h5>

<p><b>76. Words that end in silent <i>e</i> usually drop the <i>e</i> in derivatives or
before a suffix beginning with a vowel.</b></p>

<p>Examples: <i>bride</i>, <i>bridal</i>; <i>guide</i>, <i>guidance</i>; <i>please</i>, <i>pleasure</i>;

<i>writing</i>; <i>use</i>, <i>using</i>; <i>change</i>, <i>changing</i>; <i>judge</i>, <i>judging</i>;
<i>believe</i>, <i>believing</i>.</p>

<p><a name="article_76_Note1" id="article_76_Note1">Note 1.</a>&mdash;Of the exceptions some retain the <i>e</i> to prevent confusion with
other words. Exceptions: <i>dyeing</i>, <i>singeing</i>, <i>mileage</i>, <i>acreage</i>,
<i>hoeing</i>, <i>shoeing</i>, <i>agreeing</i>, <i>eyeing</i>. The exceptions cause
comparatively little trouble. One rarely sees <i>hoing</i> or <i>shoing</i>; he

the <i>e</i> is retained. The purpose of this retention is to preserve the
soft sound of the <i>c</i> or <i>g</i>. (Observe that <i>c</i> and <i>g</i> have the hard
sound in <i>cable</i>, <i>gable</i>, <i>cold</i>, <i>go</i>.)</p>

adjective before a noun:</b> <i>iron-bound bucket</i>, <i>well-kept lawn</i>,
<i>twelve-inch main</i>, <i>normal-school teacher</i>, <i>up-to-date methods</i>,
<i>twentieth-century ideas</i>, <i>devil-may-care expression</i>, <i>a
twenty-dollar-a-week clerk</i>.</p>

<p><b>But when the words follow the noun, the hyphen is omitted.</b> <i>The lawn is
well kept. Methods up to date in every way</i>.</p>

<p><b>Also adverbs ending in <i>-ly</i> are not ordinarily made into compound
modifiers:</b> <i>nicely kept lawn</i>, <i>securely guarded treasure</i>.</p>

<p><b><a name="article_78b" id="article_78b">b.</a> Use a hyphen between members of a compound noun when the second
member is a preposition, or when the writing of two nouns solid or
separately might confuse the meaning:</b> <i>runner-up</i>, <i>kick-off</i>;
<i>letting-down of effort</i>, <i>son-in-law</i>, <i>jack-o'-lantern</i>, <i>Pedro was a
bull-fighter</i>, <i>a woman-hater</i>, <i>Did you ever see a shoe-polish like
this?</i></p>

<p><b><a name="article_78c" id="article_78c">c.</a> Use a hyphen in compound numbers from twenty-one to ninety-nine, and
in fractions according to the following examples:</b></p>

<p><i>Twenty-three</i>, <i>eighty-nine</i>; but <i>one hundred and one</i>.
<i>Twenty-third</i>, <i>one-hundred-and-first man</i>. <i>Three-fourths</i>, <i>four and
two-thirds</i>, <i>thirty-hundredths</i>, <i>thirty-one hundredths</i>.</p>

<p>But omit the hyphen in simple fractions when loosely used: <i>Three
quarters of my life are spent.</i> <i>One third of his fortune.</i></p>

<p><b><a name="article_78d" id="article_78d">d.</a> A hyphen is not used in the following common words:</b> <i>airship</i>,
<i>altogether</i>, <i>anybody</i>, <i>baseball</i>, <i>basketball</i>, <i>everybody</i>,
<i>football</i>, <i>goodby</i>, <i>herself</i>, <i>handbook</i>, <i>himself</i>, <i>inasmuch</i>,

<p><b><a name="article_78e" id="article_78e">e.</a> For words that do not come within the scope of rules, consult an
up-to-date dictionary.</b> Compounds tend, with the passing of time, to grow
together. Once men wrote <i>steam boat</i>, later <i>steam-boat</i>, and finally
<i>steamboat</i>. New-coined words are usually hyphenated; old words are
often written solid. The degree of intimacy between the parts of a
compound word affects usage; thus we write <i>sun-motor</i>, but <i>sunbeam</i>;
<i>birth-rate</i>, but <i>birthday</i>; <i>cooling-room</i>, but <i>bedroom</i>;
<i>non-conductor</i>, but <i>nonsense</i>. The ease with which a vowel blends with
the consonant of a syllable adjoining it affects usage; thus
<i>self-evident</i>, but <i>selfsame</i>; <i>non-existent</i>, but <i>nondescript</i>;
<i>un-American</i>, but <i>unwise</i>. Many compounds, however, are still
uncontrolled by usage; whether they should be written as two words or
one, whether with or without the hyphen, the dictionaries themselves do
not agree.</p>

<p>Exercise:</p>

<p class="exercise">Copy the following expressions, inserting hyphens where they
are necessary: <i>twenty two years old</i>, <i>twenty two dollar
bills</i> <i>make forty dollars</i>, <i>twenty seven eighths inch

<h5><a name="article_80" id="article_80">Manuscript</a></h5>

<p><b><a name="article_80a" id="article_80a">80a.</a> Titles.</b> Center a title on the page. Capitalize important words. It
is unnecessary to place a period after a title, but a question mark or
exclamation point should be used when one is appropriate. Do not
underscore the title, or unnecessarily place it in quotation marks.
Leave a blank line under the title, before beginning the body of the
writing.</p>

<p><b><a name="article_80b" id="article_80b">b.</a> Spacing.</b> Careful spacing is as necessary as punctuation. Place
writing on a page as you would frame a picture, crowding it toward
neither the top nor the bottom. Leave liberal margins. Write verse as
verse; do not give it equal indention or length of line with prose.
Connect all the letters of a word. Leave a space after a word, and a
double space after a sentence. Leave room between successive lines, and
do not let the loops of letters run into the lines above or below.</p>

<p><b><a name="article_80c" id="article_80c">c.</a> Handwriting.</b> Write a clear, legible hand. Form <i>a</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>u</i>, <i>n</i>,
<i>e</i>, <i>i</i>, properly. Write out <i>and</i> horizontally. Avoid unnecessary
flourishes in capitals, and curlicues at the end of words. Dot your
<i>i's</i> and cross your <i>t's</i>; not with circles or long eccentric strokes,
but simply and accurately. Let your originality express itself not in
ornate penmanship, or unusual stationery, or literary affectations, but
in the force and keenness of your ideas.</p>

<p><b><a name="article_81a" id="article_81a">81a.</a> Begin with a capital a sentence, a line of poetry, or a quoted

<h5><a name="article_82" id="article_82">Italics</a></h5>

<div class="intro">
<p>In manuscript, a horizontal line drawn under a letter or word is a sign
for the printer to use italic type.</p>
</div>

<p><b><a name="article_82a" id="article_82a">82a.</a> Quoted titles of books, periodicals, and manuscripts are usually
italicized.</b></p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Right: I admire Shakespeare's <i>Hamlet</i>. [The italics make the
reader know that the writer means, <i>Hamlet</i> the play, not
Hamlet the man.]</li>

<li>Right: John Galsworthy's novel, <i>The Patrician</i>, appeared in
serial form in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>.</li></ul>

<p><a name="article_82a_Note1" id="article_82a_Note1">Note 1.</a>&mdash;When the title of a book begins with an article (<i>a</i>, <i>an</i>, or
<i>the</i>), the article is italicized. But <i>the</i> before the title of a
periodical is usually not italicized.</p>

<p><a name="article_82a_Note2" id="article_82a_Note2">Note 2.</a>&mdash;It is correct, but not the best practice, to indicate the
titles of books by quotation marks. The best method is to use italics
for the title of a book, and quotation marks for chapters or
subdivisions of the same book. Example: See <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i>,
<abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> <abbr title="two">II</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 427, "Modern Architecture".</p>

<p><b><a name="article_82b" id="article_82b">b.</a> Words from a foreign language, unless they have been anglicized by
frequent use, are italicized.</b></p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Right: A great noise announced the coming of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">enfant
terrible</i>.</li>

<li>Right: A play always begins <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in medias res</i>.</li></ul>

<p><b><a name="article_82c" id="article_82c">c.</a> The names of ships are usually italicized.</b></p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Right: The <i>Saxonia</i> will sail at four o'clock.</li></ul>

<p><b><a name="article_82d" id="article_82d">d.</a> Words taken out of their context and made the subject of discussion
are italicized or placed in quotation marks.</b></p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Right: <i>So</i> is a word faded and colorless from constant use.</li>

<li>Right: The <i>t</i> in the word <i>often</i> is not pronounced.</li></ul>

<p><b><a name="article_82e" id="article_82e">e.</a> A word or passage requiring great emphasis is italicized.</b> This device
should not be used to excess. The proper way to secure emphasis is to
have good ideas, and to use emphatic sentence structure in expressing
them.</p>

cheer.</li>

equal value) an equal distance from the margin. One inch to the right is
a good distance for successive subordinate headings. Use Roman numerals,
capital letters, Arabic numerals, and small letters to indicate the
comparative rank of ideas. When a heading runs over one line, use
hanging indention; that is, do not allow the second line to run back to
the left-hand margin, but indent it. Make the numerals and letters (<i>1</i>,
<i>A</i>, <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>) stand out prominently. The title of a theme should not be
given a numeral or letter.</p>

<div class="intro">
<p>The parts of a letter are the heading, the inside address, the greeting,
the body, the close, and the signature. For these parts good use
prescribes definite forms, which we may sometimes ignore in personal
letters, but must rigidly observe in formal or business letters.</p>
</div>

<p><b><a name="article_87a" id="article_87a">87a.</a> The heading of a letter should give the full address of the writer
and the date of writing. Do not abbreviate short words, or omit Street

<ul class="examples"><li>Objectionable: #15 Hickory, Omaha.</li>

<li>Right: 15 Hickory Street, Omaha, Nebraska.</li>

<li>Objectionable: 4/12/19; 10-28-'16; May <abbr title="second">2nd</abbr>, 1910.</li>

</li></ul>

<p><a name="article_87a_Note" id="article_87a_Note">Note.</a>&mdash;In personal letters the heading may be transferred to the end,
below the signature, at the left-hand side. But it must not be so
divided that the street address will appear in one place and the town
and state in another.</p>

<p>The "closed" form of punctuation (the use of punctuation at the ends of
the lines) is best until the student learns what is correct. Afterward,
the adoption of the "open" form becomes purely a matter of individual
taste and not a matter of carelessness or ignorance.</p>

<p><b><a name="article_87b" id="article_87b">b.</a> An inside address and a greeting are required in business letters.</b>
Personal letters contain the greeting, but may omit the inside address,
or may supply it at the end of the letter.</p>

<li>Dear Professor Ward:</li>
<li>Dear Jones,</li>
<li>Dear Mrs. Vincent,</li>
<li>Dear Robert,</li>
<li>Dear Olive,</li>
</ul>

<p>"My dear Miss Brown" is more ceremonious than "Dear Miss Brown". As a
rule, the more familiar the letter, the shorter the greeting.</p>

<p>A colon follows the greeting if the letter is formal or long; a comma,
if the letter is familiar or in the nature of a note.</p>

<p>Both inside address and greeting begin at the left-hand margin. The body
of the letter begins on the line below the greeting, and is indented as
much as an ordinary paragraph (about an inch).</p>

<p><b><a name="article_87c" id="article_87c">c.</a> The body of a letter should be written in correct style.</b></p>

<p><b>1.</b> Do not omit pronouns, or write a "telegraphic style".</p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Wrong: Just received yours of the <abbr title="twenty-first">21st</abbr>, and in reply would say
your order has been filled and shipped.</li>

<li>Right: I have your letter of March twenty-first. Your order was
promptly filled and shipped.</li></ul>

<p><b>2.</b> The idea that it is immodest to use <i>I</i> is a superstition. Undue
repetition of <i>I</i> is of course awkward; but entire avoidance of it is
silly.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> Use simple language. Say "your letter"; not "your kind favor", or
"yours duly received", or "yours of the <abbr title="twenty-first">21st</abbr> is at hand".</p>

<p><b>4.</b> Avoid "begging" expressions which you obviously do not mean,
especially the hackneyed "beg to advise".</p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Wrong: Received yours of the <abbr title="third">3rd</abbr> instant, and beg to advise we
are out of stock.</li>

<li>Right: We received your order of March 3. We find that we have
no more dining-room chairs B 2-4-6 in stock.</li>

<li>Wrong: I beg to enclose a booklet.</li>

<li>Right: I enclose a booklet.</li>

<li>Wrong: Permit us to say that prices have been advanced.</li>

<li>Right: The prices on our goods have been advanced.</li></ul>

<p><b>5.</b> Avoid the formula "please find enclosed". The reader will find what
is enclosed; if you use "please", let it refer to what the reader shall
do with what is enclosed.</p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Wrong: Enclosed please find 10 cents, for which send me
Bulletin 58.</li>

<li>Right: I enclose ten cents, for which please send me Bulletin
58.</li></ul>

<p><b>6.</b> Avoid unnecessary commercial slang: <i>On the job</i>, <i>A-1 service</i>,
<i>O.K.</i>, <i>your ad</i>, <i>popular-priced line</i>, <i>this party</i>, <i>as per
schedule</i>.</p>

<p><b>7.</b> Get to the important idea quickly. In applying for a position, do not
beat around the bush, or say you "wish to apply" or "would apply".
Begin, "I make application for ...", "kindly consider my application for
...", or "I apply ..."</p>

<p><b>8.</b> Group your ideas logically. Do not scatter information. A letter
applying for a position might consist of three paragraphs: Personal
qualifications (age, health, education, <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>); Experience (nature of
positions, dates, <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>); References (names, business or profession,
exact street address). Finish one group of ideas before passing to the
next.</p>

<p><b>9.</b> Do not monotonously close all letters with a sentence beginning with
a participle: <i>Hoping to hear from you ...</i>, <i>Asking your co&ouml;peration
...</i>, <i>Awaiting your further favors ...</i>, <i>Trusting this will be
satisfactory ...</i>, <i>Wishing you ...</i>, <i>Thanking you ...</i>. The
independent form of the verb is more emphatic (see <a href="#article_42">42</a>); <i>I hope to hear
from you ...</i>, <i>We await further orders ...</i>, <i>We ask co&ouml;peration ...</i>.</p>

<p><b><a name="article_87d" id="article_87d">d.</a> The close</b> should be consistent in tone with the greeting. It is
written on a separate line, beginning near the middle of the page, and
is followed by a comma. Only the first word is capitalized. Preceding
expressions like "I am", "I remain", "As ever", (if they are used at
all) belong in the body of the letter.</p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Right: I thank you for your courtesy, and remain<br /><br />

<div class="signature">Yours sincerely,<br />
<span class="i1">Robert Blair<br /></span></div></li>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>

<p>I apply for a position as mechanic's assistant in the
electrical department of your shops. I am nineteen years old,
and in good physical condition. On June 6 I shall graduate from
Carthage High School, and after that date I can begin work
immediately.</p>

<p>I have had no practical experience in electrical work. But I
have for two years made a special study of physics, in and out
of school. I worked last summer in the local garage of <abbr title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> R.
S. Bryant. In addition, I have become familiar with tools in my
workshop at home, so that I both know and like machinery.</p>

<p>For statements as to my character and ability, I refer you to
R.&nbsp;S. Bryant, Manager Bryant's Garage; <abbr title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> Frank Darrow
(lawyer), 602 Ninth Street; W.&nbsp;C. Barnes, Superintendent of

<h5><a name="article_88" id="article_88">Paragraphs</a></h5>

<p><b><a name="article_88a" id="article_88a">88a.</a> The first lines of paragraphs are uniformly indented, in
manuscript, about an inch; in print, somewhat less. After a sentence,
the remainder of a line should not be left blank, except at the end of a
paragraph.</b></p>

<p><b><a name="article_88b" id="article_88b">b.</a> The length of a paragraph is ordinarily from fifty to three hundred
words, depending on the importance or complexity of the thought.</b> In
exposition, the paragraphs should be long enough to develop every idea
thoroughly. Scrappy expository paragraphs arouse the suspicion that the
writer is incoherent, or that he has not given sufficient thought to the
subject. Short paragraphs are permissible, and even desirable, in the
following cases:</p>

<p><b>1.</b> In a formal introduction to the main body of a discourse, or in the
formal conclusion. (In some instances the paragraph may consist of a
single sentence.<ins title="Transcriber's Note: The original was missing parenthesis">)</ins></p>

<p><b>2.</b> In the body of a composition, when a brief logical transition between
two longer paragraphs is necessary.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> In short compositions on complex subjects, where space forbids the
development of each thought on a proper scale. (But, as a rule, the
student should limit his subject to a few simple ideas, each of which
can be developed fully.)</p>

<p><b>4.</b> In newspapers, where brevity and emphasis are required. (But the
student should not take the journalistic style as a model.)</p>

<p><b>5.</b> In description or narration meant to be vivid, vigorous, or rapid.</p>

<p><b>6.</b> In dialogue.</p>

<p><b><a name="article_88c" id="article_88c">c.</a> In representing dialogue, each speech, no matter how short, is placed
in a separate paragraph.</b></p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Right:

<blockquote><p>"Listen!" he said. "There was a noise
outside. Didn't you hear it?"</p>

<p>"No," I whispered. It was dark in the room, except for a faint
light at the window, and I felt my way cautiously to his side.
"What is it? Burglars?"</p>

<p>"I believe it is."</p>

<p>"I can't hear anything."</p>

<p>"Listen! There it is again."</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" I had to laugh aloud. "Thompson's cow has got into the
garden again."</p></blockquote>
</li></ul>

<p>Note that a slight amount of descriptive matter may be included in a
paragraph with the direct discourse, the only requirement being that a
change of speaker shall be indicated by a new paragraph.</p>

<p>When special emphasis is desired, a quotation may be detached from a
preceding introductory statement.</p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Right: <p>The speaker turned gravely about, and facing the front
row, he said slowly and solemnly:</p>

<p>"Small boys should be seen and not heard."</p></li></ul>

<p>In exceptional cases a long, rapid-fire dialogue may, for purposes of
compression, be placed in one paragraph. Dashes should then be used
before successive quotations to indicate a change of speaker.</p>

<p>Omissions from a dialogue (as when only one side of a telephone
conversation is reported), long pauses, and the unfinished part of
interrupted statements, may be represented by a short row of dots.</p>

<p>Exercise:</p>

<h2><a name="punctuation" id="punctuation">PUNCTUATION</a></h2>

<div class="intro">
<p>Punctuation is not used for its own sake. It is used in writing as
gestures, pauses, and changes of voice are used in speaking&mdash;to add
force or to reveal the precise relationship of thoughts. The tendency at
present is against the lavish use of punctuation. This does not mean,
however, that one may do as he pleases. In minor details of punctuation
there is room for individual preference, but in essential principles all
trustworthy writers agree.</p>
</div>

<h5><a name="article_90" id="article_90">The Period</a></h5>

<p><b><a name="article_90a" id="article_90a">90a.</a> Place a period after a complete declarative or imperative sentence.</b></p>

<p><b><a name="article_90b" id="article_90b">b.</a> Do not separate part of a sentence from the rest of the sentence by
means of a period. (See <a href="#article_1">1</a>.)</b></p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Wrong: He denied the accusation. As every one expected him to
do.</li>

<li>Right: He denied the accusation, as every one expected him to
do.</li>

<li>Wrong: Anderson wrote good editorials. The best that appeared

<li>Right: Anderson wrote good editorials, the best that appeared
in any paper in the city. [Or] Anderson wrote good
editorials&mdash;the best that appeared in any paper in the city.</li></ul>

<p>Exception.&mdash;Condensed or elliptical phrases established by long and
frequent use may be written as separate sentences. They should be
followed by appropriate punctuation&mdash;usually by a period.</p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Examples: Yes. Of course. Really? By all means!</li></ul>

<p><a name="article_90b_Note" id="article_90b_Note">Note.</a>&mdash;The student should distinguish clearly between a subordinate
clause and a main clause. A subordinate clause is introduced by a
subordinate conjunction (<i>when</i>, <i>while</i>, <i>if</i>, <i>as</i>, <i>since</i>,
<i>although</i>, <i>that</i>, <i>lest</i>, <i>because</i>, <i>in order that</i>, <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>), or by a
relative pronoun (<i>who</i>, <i>which</i>, <i>that</i>, <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>). Since a subordinate
clause does not express a complete thought, it cannot stand alone, but
must be joined to a main clause to form a sentence.</p>

<p><b><a name="article_90c" id="article_90c">c.</a> Place a period after an abbreviation.</b></p>

<ul class="examples"><li><abbr title="Brothers">Bros.</abbr>  <abbr title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>  <abbr title="for example">e. g.</abbr>  <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">Ph.D.</abbr>  <abbr title="Doctor of Laws">LL.D.</abbr>  <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr></li></ul>

<p>If an abbreviation falls at the end of a sentence, one period may serve
two functions.</p>

<p>Exercise:</p>

<ol class="exercise"><li>The hen clucks to her chickens. When she scratches up a
worm.</li>

<li>Before my brother could forewarn me. I had touched my tongue
against the cold iron. On which it stuck.</li>

Court.</li></ol>


<h5><a name="article_91" id="article_91">The Comma</a></h5>

<div class="intro">
<p>There are five principal uses of the comma:</p>

<ul>
<li>to separate clauses (<a href="#article_91a">a</a>-<a href="#article_91d">d</a>)</li>
<li>to set off a parenthetical element (<a href="#article_91e">e</a>)</li>
<li>to mark a series (<a href="#article_91f">f</a>-<a href="#article_91g">g</a>)</li>
<li>to introduce a quotation (<a href="#article_91h">h</a>)</li>
<li>to compel a pause for the sake of clearness (<a href="#article_91i">i</a>)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p><b><a name="article_91a" id="article_91a">91a.</a> A comma is used between clauses joined by <i>but</i>, <i>for</i>, <i>and</i>, or
any other co&ouml;rdinating conjunction.</b></p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Right: The hour arrived, but Forbes did not appear. [The comma
emphasizes the contrast.]</li>

<li>Right: She was glad she had looked, for a man was approaching
the house. [The comma prevents the combination <i>looked for a
man</i>.]</li>

<li>Right: He gave the money to Burke, and Reynolds received
nothing. [The comma prevents confusion.]</li></ul>

<p>Exception.&mdash;If the clauses are short and closely linked in thought, the
comma may be omitted (She came and she was gone in a moment. McCoy
talked and the rest of us listened.<ins title="Transcriber's Note: The original was missing parenthesis">)</ins> If the
clauses are long and complicated, a semicolon may be used (See
<a href="#article_92b">92b</a>).</p>

<p><a name="article_91a_Note" id="article_91a_Note">Note.</a>&mdash;No comma should follow the conjunction. Wrong: He was
enthusiastic but, inexperienced. Wrong: They went before the committee
but, not one of them would answer a question.</p>

<p><b><a name="article_91b" id="article_91b">b.</a> Do <i>not</i> use a comma between independent clauses which are <i>not</i>
joined by a conjunction. Use a period or a semicolon.</b> (This error, the
"comma splice," betrays ignorance of what constitutes a unified
sentence. See <a href="#article_18">18</a>.)</p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Wrong: The circus had just come to town, every one wanted to
see it.</li>

<li>Right: The circus had just come to town. Every one wanted to
see it.</li>

<li>Wrong: The story deals with the life of a youth, Don Juan, his
mother desired to make an angel of him.</li>

<li>Right: The story deals with the life of a youth, Don Juan. His
mother desired to make an angel of him.</li>

<li>Wrong: My courses required very hard study, did yours?</li>

<li>Right: My courses required very hard study. Did yours? [Or] My
courses required very hard study; did yours?</li>

<li>Wrong: He will assist you without the slightest hesitation,
indeed he will do so with alacrity.</li>

<li>Right: He will assist you without the slightest hesitation.
Indeed he will do so with alacrity. [Or] He will assist you
without the slightest hesitation; indeed he will do so with
alacrity.</li></ul>

<p>Exception.&mdash;Short co&ouml;rdinate clauses which are not joined by
conjunctions, but which are parallel in structure and leave a unified
impression, may be joined by commas.</p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Right: He sowed, he reaped, he repented.</li></ul>

<p><b><a name="article_91c" id="article_91c">c.</a> An adverbial clause which precedes a main clause is usually set off
by a comma.</b></p>

<p>When long:</p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Right: While I have much confidence in his sincerity, I cannot
approve his decision. [The comma marks the meeting point of
clauses too long to be easily read together. Brief clauses do
not require the comma. Right: Where thou goest I will go.]</li></ul>

<p>When ending in words that link themselves with words in the main
clause:</p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Right: If Jacob finds time to plow, the garden can be planted
tomorrow. [The comma prevents <i>plow the garden</i> from being read
as verb and object.]</li></ul>

<p>When not closely connected with the main clause in meaning:</p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Right: Although they were few, they were resolute. [Here the
comma reveals the distinctness of the two stages of thought. In
the sentence <i>If it freezes the skating will be good</i> the
distinctness of the two thoughts is less emphatic, and the
comma may be omitted.]</li></ul>

<p><a name="article_91c_Note" id="article_91c_Note">Note.</a>&mdash;The comma is usually omitted when the adverbial clause follows
the main clause.</p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Right: The score stood twelve to twelve when the first half
ended. [The adverbial clause is linked closely with the element
it modifies, the predicate; punctuation is unnecessary. If the
<i>when</i> clause were placed before the element it does not
modify, the subject, a comma should be inserted.]</li></ul>

<p><b><a name="article_91d" id="article_91d">d.</a> Restrictive clauses should not be set off by commas; non-restrictive
clauses should be set off by commas.</b> (A restrictive clause is one
inseparably connected with the noun or pronoun it modifies; to omit it
would change the thought of the main clause. A non-restrictive clause is
less vitally connected with the noun or pronoun; to omit it would not
affect the thought of the main clause.)</p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Right: Men who are industrious will succeed. [The relative
clause restricts the meaning; it is inseparably connected with
the noun it modifies, and to omit it would change the thought
of the main clause.]</li>

<li>Right: Thomas Carlyle, who wrote forty volumes, was of peasant
origin. [The relative clause is non-restrictive; it is not
inseparably connected with the noun it modifies, and to omit
it would not change the thought of the main clause. Thus:
Thomas Carlyle was of peasant origin.]</li>

<li>Right: Where is the house that Jack built? [Restrictive.]</li>

<li>Right: I went to Jack's house, which is across the street.
[Non-restrictive.]</li>

<li>Wrong: Students, who are lazy, do not deserve to pass. [The
sentence as it stands says that all students are lazy, and that
none of them deserve to pass. Without the commas, the sentence
would mean that such students as are lazy do not deserve to
pass.]</li>

<li>Right: Students who are lazy do not deserve to pass.</li></ul>

<p><b>The rule stated above for clauses applies also to phrases.</b></p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Right. She, hearing the voice, turned quickly. [<i>Hearing the
voice</i> is non-restrictive. It does not identify <i>she</i>, and the
thought of the main clause is complete without it.]</li>

<li>Right: Books pertaining to aeronautics are in demand.
[<i>Pertaining to aeronautics</i> is restrictive. It explains what
books are referred to, and without it the meaning of the main
thought is changed.]</li>

<li>Right: Our country, made up as it is of democratic people,
lacks the centralized power of a monarchy. [Non-restrictive.]</li>

<li>Right: A country made up of democratic people must be lacking
in centralized power. [Restrictive. <i>Made up of democratic
people</i> explains <i>country</i> and is essential to the thought of
the sentence.]</li></ul>

<p><b><a name="article_91e" id="article_91e">e.</a> Slightly parenthetical elements are set off by commas:</b></p>

<p>Direct address or explanation:</p>

was my brother Robert. (3) When the appositive is a word or
phrase to which attention is called by italics or some other
device which sets it apart. Right: The word <i>sequent</i> is
derived from Latin. Right: The expression "That's fine" is one

<h5><a name="article_92" id="article_92">The Semicolon</a></h5>

<div class="intro">
<p>The semicolon represents a division in thought somewhat greater than
that represented by a comma, and somewhat smaller than that represented
by a period. It may represent grammatical separation and logical
connection at the same time; that is, it may indicate that two
statements are separate units in grammar, and are yet to be taken
together to form a larger unit of logic or thought.</p>
</div>

<p><b><a name="article_92a" id="article_92a">92a.</a> The semicolon is used between co&ouml;rdinate clauses which are not
joined by a conjunction.</b> (For a possible exception see <a href="#article_91b">91b</a>.).</p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Wrong: He was alarmed in fact he was terrified.</li>

<li>Right: He was alarmed; in fact he was terrified.</li>

<li>Right: He drew up at the curb; he leaped from the car.</li></ul>

<p><a name="article_92a_Note" id="article_92a_Note">Note.</a>&mdash;Very often the writer may choose freely between the semicolon and
the period; in such instances the use of the semicolon implies greater
logical unity between the clauses than the use of the period would show.
Unless this logical unity is distinct, the period is to be preferred.</p>

<p><b><a name="article_92b" id="article_92b">b.</a> The semicolon is sometimes used between co&ouml;rdinate clauses which are
joined by a conjunction if the clauses are long, or if the clauses have
commas within themselves, or if obscurity would result were the
semicolon not used.</b> (Otherwise, see <a href="#article_91a">91a</a>.)</p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Right: Very slowly the glow in the heavens deepened and
extended itself along the eastern horizon; but at last the

immediately going to a hotel, called for a room.</li>

<p><b><a name="article_92c" id="article_92c">c.</a> The semicolon is used between co&ouml;rdinate clauses which are joined by
a formal conjunctive adverb (<i>hence</i>, <i>thus</i>, <i>then</i>, <i>therefore</i>,
<i>accordingly</i>, <i>consequently</i>, <i>besides</i>, <i>still</i>, <i>nevertheless</i>, or
the like).</b></p>

<li>Right: He was tattered and muddy; besides he ate like a

<p><a name="article_91c_Note1" id="article_91c_Note1">Note 1.</a>&mdash;If a simple conjunction like <i>and</i> is used in the sentences
above, a comma will suffice. But a comma is not sufficient before a
conjunctive adverb like <i>therefore</i>. Conjunctive adverbs may be clearly
distinguished from simple conjunctions (See <a href="#article_91a">91a</a>). They
cannot always be easily distinguished from subordinating conjunctions
(see <a href="#article_90b_Note">90b, Note</a>), but the distinction, when it can be made
with certainty, is an aid to clear thinking.</p>

<p><a name="article_91c_Note2" id="article_91c_Note2">Note 2.</a>&mdash;Good usage sometimes permits a comma to be used before a
conjunctive adverb in short sentences where the break in the thought is
not formal or emphatic. For instance, when the conjunctive adverb <i>so</i>
is used as a formal or emphatic connective, a semicolon is desirable (I
won't go; so that's settled). But in the sentence, "I was excited, so I
missed the target", a comma is sufficient. For the use of <i>so</i> is here
informal, and probably expresses degree as well as result. (Compare "I
was so excited that I missed the target").</p>

<p><b><a name="article_92d" id="article_92d">d.</a> The semicolon is not used before quotations, or after the "Dear Sir"

considerations of spacing. But logic, not spacing, should determine the
order, and all three marks should be treated alike. They should be
placed within the quotation marks if they were a part of the original
quotation; otherwise outside. In quoting manuscript, the quotation marks

itself interrogatory, a question mark follows.</p>

<ul class="examples"><li>Right: Did she inquire whether you had met her aunt?</li></ul>

<p><b><a name="article_98b" id="article_98b">b.</a> A question mark is often used within a sentence, but should not be
followed by a comma, semicolon, or period.</b></p>

<p><b><a name="article_98d" id="article_98d">d.</a> The use of a question mark as a label for humor or irony is childish.</b></p>

<li>Better: Immediately the social lion rose to his feet.</li></ul>

<p><b><a name="article_98e" id="article_98e">e.</a> The exclamation point is used after words, expressions, or sentences
to show strong emotion.</b></p>
